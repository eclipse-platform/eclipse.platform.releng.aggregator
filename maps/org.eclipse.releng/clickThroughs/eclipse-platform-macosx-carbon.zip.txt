This is a very experimental build for Mac OS X 10.2.x (it does not run earlier versions of Mac OS X!).

At this point please report any problems related to the build to the platform-releng-dev@eclipse.org mailing list.


Important note about unpacking Eclipse on MacOS X:

Out of the box, Zip files are unzipped using Stuffit Expander. If your version of Stuffit Expander is older than version 7.0 (released 09/19/2002), it does not handle the long filenames that the Eclipse build uses and ends up truncating them, which causes numerous problems.

Furthermore, Mac users use IE 5.2 by default, and the download manager will by default automatically unzip downloads using this mechanism. In addition IE 5.2 does not preserve the long file name of the Eclipse Zip archive, so it ends up in "eclipse-SDK-I20021029-macosx-ca".

So before downloading and unpacking Eclipse we recommend to install the free upgrade to Stuffit Expander 7.0.

However, if you want to unzip the build yourself and assuming you download to the desktop, from a terminal window type:

cd ~/desktop
unzip eclipse-SDK-I20021029-macosx-ca
