  displayName('Rename and Promote')
  description('''
This job does the "stage 1" or first part of a promotion. It renames the files for Equinox and Eclipse, creates an appropriate repo on "downloads", rsync's everything to 'downloads', but leave everything "invisible" -- unless someone knows the exact URL. This allows two things. First, allows artifacts some time to "mirror" when that is needed. But, also, allows the sites and repositories to be examined for correctness before making them visible to the world. 

The second (deferred) step that makes things visible works, in part, based on some output of this first step. Hence, they must "share a workspace".
