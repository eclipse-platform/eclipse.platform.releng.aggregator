  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>The welcome page is the first page you see when you first launch eclipse. Its purpose is to introduce you to the
  product. Welcome content will vary from one Eclipse based product to another, it typically includes an overview of
  the product and its features, tutorials to guide you through some basic tasks, samples to get you started, etc.</p>
  <p>There are many possible forms of welcome, ranging from simple static text to elaborate extendable multi-page
  presentations. The Eclipse platform and platform SDK uses a form known as <strong>Universal Welcome</strong>, which
  defines a common page structure, allowing several products to share the welcome space. If your product is using the
  Universal Welcome, you can <a href="../tasks/welcome.htm">customize</a> its appearance using the "customize page"
  button. Products which use universal welcome will display a welcome page the first time they are restarted after new
  features with welcome content are installed and highlight the new welcome content.</p>
