  <h1 class="Head">Views</h1>
  <p>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well as ways to navigate the information in your
  Workbench. For example, the Project Explorer and other navigation views display projects and other resources that you
  are working with.</p>
  <p>Views also have their own menus. To open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left end of the view's title
  bar. Some views also have their own toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view toolbars only affect the
  items within that view.</p>
  <p>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook. You can change the layout of a
  perspective by opening and closing views and by docking them in different positions in the Workbench window.</p>
