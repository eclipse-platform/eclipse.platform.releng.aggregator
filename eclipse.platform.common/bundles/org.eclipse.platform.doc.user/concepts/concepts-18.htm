  <h1 class="Head">Toolbars</h1>
  <p>There are four kinds of toolbars in the Workbench.</p>
  <p>The <i>main toolbar</i>, sometimes called the Workbench toolbar, is displayed at the top of the Workbench window
  directly beneath the menu bar. The contents of this toolbar change based on the active perspective. Items in the
  toolbar might be enabled or disabled based on the state of either the active view or editor. Sections of the main
  toolbar can be rearranged using the mouse.</p>
  <p>There are also individual <i>view toolbars</i>, which appear in the title bar of a view. Actions in a view's
  toolbar apply only to the view in which they appear. Some view toolbars include a <b>Menu</b> button, shown as an
  inverted triangle, that contain actions for that view.</p>
  <p class="Head">A third type of toolbar is the perspective switcher. The perspective switcher allows quick access to
  perspectives that are currently open. It also has a button that can open new perspectives. The perspective switcher
  is normally located in the top-right, next to the main toolbar. However, it is also possible to position it below the
  main toolbar ("top-left"), or to position it vertically on the left-hand side of the workbench ("left"). The name of
  the perspectives is shown by default, but it is possible to hide the text and show only the icons. To reposition the
  perspective or hide the text, right-click on it and choose the appropriate item from the context menu.</p>
  <p class="Head">Minimizing a view stack will also produce a toolbar in the trim at the outer edge of the workbench
  window (a <i>Trim Stack</i>). This bar will contain an icon for each of the views in the stack. Clicking on one of
  these icons will result in the view being displayed as an overlay onto the existing presentation.</p>
  <p class="Head">In all cases, you can find out what toolbar buttons do by moving your mouse pointer over the button
  and reading the tooltip that opens. See the list of related reference topics below for a table of all toolbar
  buttons.</p>
