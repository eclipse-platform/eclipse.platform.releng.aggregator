  <h1 class="Head">Problems View</h1>
  <p class="Para">As you work with resources in the workbench, various builders may automatically log problems, errors,
  or warnings in the Problems view. For example, when you save a Java source file that contains syntax errors, those
  will be logged in the Problems view. When you double-click the icon for a problem, error, or warning, the editor for
  the associated resource automatically opens to the relevant line of code.</p>
  <p class="Head">By default the Problems view will group your problems by severity. You can also group them by type or
  not at all. Certain components will add their own grouping. For instance the Java development tools (JDT) support
  adds a Java Problem Type group. The grouping can be selected using the <b>Group By</b> menu.</p>
  <p class="Head">The first column of the Problems view displays an icon that denotes the type of line item, the
  category and the description. Left-click the item to open the file in an editor and highlight the line containing the
  problem.</p>
  <p class="Head">You can configure the contents of the Problems view to view only warnings and errors associated with
  a particular resource or group of resources. This is done using the <b>Filters</b> dialog available from the drop
  down menu. You can add multiple filters to the Problems view and enable or disable them as required. Filters can
  either be additive (any problem that satisfies at least one of the enables filters will be shown) or exclusive (only
  problems that satisfy all of the filters will be shown) The two most popular filters (All Errors and Warnings on
  Selection) are provided by default.</p>
  <p>Problems can be fixed by selecting <b>Quick Fix</b> from the context menu. The list of possible resolutions will
  be shown in a dialog.</p>
  <p class="Head">To add the Problems view to the current perspective, click <a class="command-link" href=
