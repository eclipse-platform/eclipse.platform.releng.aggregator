  <title>Navigating the User Interface Using the Keyboard</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Navigating the User Interface Using the Keyboard</h1>
  <p>The user interface is navigable using the keyboard. The Tab key is used to iterate through the controls in a
  window (for example, a dialog, or the current perspective's views and editors and the main controls for the Workbench
  window). To tab out of views that use the Tab key (such as editors) use Ctrl+Tab. When the focus is on an editor or
  view tab, pressing the left/right arrow key moves to the previous/next tab and pressing Enter moves the focus to the
  current selection in the editor or view.</p>
  <h2>Menus</h2>
  <p>Most menus are assigned mnemonics for each entry which allow you to select them by typing the underlined letter
  instead of the mouse. You can also select an item by moving through the menus and sub-menus with the arrow keys.</p>
  <p>The various menus available can be accessed using the keyboard in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>F10 accesses the menus on the main menu bar.</li>
    <li>Shift+F10 pops up the context menu for the current view. (Note: this shortcut is actually dependent on your
    window manager, but for most people it should be Shift+F10.)</li>
    <li>Ctrl+F10 will open the pull down menu for the current view if there is one. For editors, Ctrl+F10 will open the
    menu for the marker bar on the left of the editor area.</li>
    <li>Alt+mnemonic will activate the Workbench menu for a particular entry (e.g., Alt+W will bring down the Window
    menu).</li>
    <li>Microsoft Windows only: Pressing Alt will give focus to the menu bar.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>Mnemonics are assigned to most control labels (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) in dialog boxes,
  preference pages, and property pages. To access the control associated with a label, use the Alt key along with the
  letter that is underlined in the label.</p>
  <h2>Navigation Context</h2>
  <p>Navigation context is saved for the packages, navigator views, Workbench preferences and properties dialogs. The
  selected page for the preferences and properties dialog is saved between invocations of the dialog but are not saved
  between workbench invocations.</p>
  <h2>Cycling Editors, Views and Perspectives</h2>
  <p>To switch between editors, views and perspectives, the workbench provides a cycling function that is invoked by
  Ctrl and a function key. All of these cycling functions recall the last thing selected to allow for rapid cycling
  back and forth between two items. The cycling functions are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ctrl+F6 - Cycle to Editor</li>
    <li>Ctrl+F7 - Cycle to View</li>
    <li>Ctrl+F8 - Cycle to Perspective</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you use the "StickyKeys" input, you might need to enable the "Keep next/previous editor, view and perspectives
  dialog open" option on the <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Workbench)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>General</strong></a> preference
  page.</p>
  <p>Also, Ctrl+E can be used to activate the editor drop-down, and Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown can be used for
  switching between open editors, or between views within the same context.</p>
  <h2>Accelerators</h2>
  <p>Many of the actions in Eclipse have an accelerator assigned to them. For additional information on accelerators,
  see <a href="keyboardshortcuts.htm">Keys</a>.</p>
  <h2>Find Actions</h2>
  <p>To quickly access UI elements such as views, commands, preference pages, and others, you can use the Find Actions
  dialog, available under <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.quickAccess")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Window &gt; Navigation &gt; Find
  Actions</b></a> and bound to <b>Ctrl+3</b> by default. Start typing in the filter field to see matches. For example,
  to open the help view, type <b>Ctrl+3</b> followed by "help". One of the first matches will be to open the help view;
  other matches show commands and preference pages related to help. You can use the arrow keys to select a different
  match for a given filter string. Press Enter to select the highlighted entry. This will execute the command, or open
  the view, perspective, or wizard etc.</p>
  <h2>Following Embedded Links</h2>
  <p>For links embedded in dialogs, such as the links between preference pages, or hyper-links in the About dialog,
  press "Space" key to activate the currently selected link.</p>
  <h2>Changing Size of Views and Editors</h2>
  <p>You can adjust size of most views and editors using commands in the "Size" system menu. By default the system menu
  for the active part is bound to <b>Alt+"-"</b>. After a "Size" submenu (Left, Right, Top, or Bottom) is selected, the
  selected part's side will be highlighted and can be moved using the arrow keys.</p>
  <h2>Help System</h2>
  <p>You can navigate the help system by keyboard using the following key combinations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pressing Tab inside a frame (page) takes you to the next link, button or topic node.</li>
    <li>To expand/collapse a tree node, press Right/Left arrows.</li>
    <li>To move to the next topic node, press Down arrow or Tab</li>
    <li>To move to the previous topic node, press Up arrow or Shift+Tab</li>
    <li>To display selected topic, press Enter.</li>
    <li>To scroll all the way up or down press Home or End.</li>
    <li>To go back press Alt+Left arrow; to go forward press Alt+Right arrow.</li>
    <li>To go to the next frame, or toolbar press Ctrl+Tab (Ctrl+F6, if using Mozilla, or Mozilla based browser).</li>
    <li>To move to previous frame, press Shift+Ctrl+Tab. (Shift-Ctrl+F6, if using Mozilla, or Mozilla based
    browser).</li>
    <li>To move to the frame displaying topic content press Alt+K (when using embedded help browser on Windows, or
    Internet Explorer).</li>
    <li>To move to Contents tab, press Alt+C</li>
    <li>To move to Search Results tab, press Alt+R</li>
    <li>To move between tabs, press Right/Left arrows.</li>
    <li>To switch view, select a tab and press Enter.</li>
    <li>To switch and move to a view, select a tab and press Up arrow.</li>
    <li>To move to the search entry field, press Alt+S</li>
    <li>To print the current page or active frame, press Ctrl+P.</li>
    <li>To find a string in the current page or active frame, press Ctrl+F (when using embedded help browser on
    Windows, or Internet Explorer).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most labels of controls on help system pop-up dialogs have mnemonics are assigned to them. To access the control
  associated with a label, use the Alt key along with the letter that is underlined.</p>
