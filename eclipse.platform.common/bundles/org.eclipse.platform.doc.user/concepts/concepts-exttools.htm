  <h1>External Tools</h1>
  <p>External tools allow you to configure and run programs, batch files, Ant buildfiles, and others using the
  Workbench. You can save these external tool configurations and run them at a later time.</p>
  <p>Output from external tools is displayed in the <b><a href=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/console/ref-console_view.htm">Console view</a></b>.</p>
  <p>You can add external tools as part of the build process for a project. These external tools will run in the
  specified order every time a project is built.</p>
  <p>The following variables are available when you configure an external tool. These variables are automatically
  expanded each time the external tool is run.</p>

  <p>Lets assume your Eclipse workspace directory is <code>c:\eclipse\workspace</code> and you have two projects,
  <code>MyProject1</code> and <code>MyProject2</code>. The first project, <code>MyProject1</code>, is located inside
  the workspace directory, the second project, <code>MyProject2</code>, is located outside the workspace directory at
  <code>c:\projects\MyProject2</code>. Lets look at how the variable examples below will be expanded when an external
  tool is run, if the resource <code>/MyProject2/MyFolder/MyFile.txt</code> is selected.</p>
