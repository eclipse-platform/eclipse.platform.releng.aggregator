  <h1 class="Head">Virtual Folders</h1>
  <p>Virtual folders are folders that exist only in the Eclipse workspace tree, and have no file system location.</p>
  <p>By using virtual folders, file and folders can be organized in a project hierarchy independently of the file
  system location of those resources.</p>
  <p>Regular file and folder resources can not be created under a virtual folder, since they need a file system
  location as their parent in order to exist in the file system. Only other virtual folders, or linked resources can be
  created directly under a virtual folder.</p>
