  <h1 class="Head">Resource Filters</h1>
  <p>Resource filters allow you to configure which files and folders are included automatically in a project resource
  hierarchy when refresh is performed.</p>
  <p>By adding resource filters to a project or folder, you can systematically prevent some file system entries to be
  displayed in the resource tree.</p>
  <p>A resource filter is either of <b>Include Only</b> or <b>Exclude All</b> type, and can apply to either files,
  folders, or both.</p>
  <p>Resource filters only apply to files and/or folders that are implicitly included in the workspace by the refresh
  operation. Link files and folders are not affected by resource filters, since they need to be created explicitly by
  the user.</p>
  <p>An "Include" resource filter allows only files and/or folders that match the filter condition to be included in
  the workspace during the refresh operation. If multiple "Include" filters exist, the elements included will be those
  who match any of the existing "Include" filters.</p>
  <p>An "Exclude" resource filter prevent all files and/or folders that match the filter condition to be included in
  the workspace during the refresh operation. If multiple "Exclude" filters exist, the elements excluded will be those
  who match any of the existing "Exclude" filters.</p>
  <p>If both "Exclude" and "Include" resource filters exist in a given folder or project, only files and/or folders
  that match any of the "Include" filters <b>and</b> do not match any of the "Exclude" filters will be included in the
  workspace.</p>
  <p>A resource filter can apply recursively to all children of the project or folder it is created on. In such case,
  the resource filter will apply to a sub-folder as if it was created in that sub-folder itself, following the rules
  mentioned above.</p>
  <p>Resource filters can be created, edited and removed in the <b>File &gt; Properties &gt; Resource &gt; Resources
  Filters</b> property page for a project or folder resource.</p>
  <p>Resource filters can also be created on a folder before that folder is created in the workspace by selecting the
  "Resource Filters..." button in the "Advanced" section of the <b>New Folder wizard</b>.</p>
