  <h1 class="Head">Working Sets</h1>
  <p>Working sets group elements for display in views or for operations on a set of elements.</p>
  <p>The navigation views use working sets to restrict the set of resources that are displayed. If a working set is
  selected in the navigator, only resources, children of resources, and parents of resources contained in the working
  set are shown. The problems view, tasks view and bookmarks view can all be filtered based on a working set via the
  <b>Filters</b> view menu item. When using the search facility, you can also use working sets to restrict the set of
  elements that are searched.</p>
  <p>Different views provide different ways to specify a working set. The views in the Eclipse SDK use the <b>Window
  Working Set</b> by default. The Window Working Set is initially empty. In order to modify the window working set you
  need to enable the <b>Window Working Set</b> command group via <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Customize
  Perspective...</b>. You can then modify the window working set via <b>Window &gt; Working Sets</b> menu or via
  corresponding toolbar button. Views that support working sets use a working set selection dialog to manage existing
  working sets and to create new working sets:</p>
  <p>When you create a new working set you can choose from different types of working sets. You can create a resource
  working set, a Java working set or a help working set.</p>
  <p>If you create a new resource working set you will be able to select the working. The same wizard is used to edit
  an existing working set. Different types of working sets provide different kinds of working set editing wizards.</p>
  <p>Working sets may also be a part of a manual build workflow. With autobuild disabled the <b>Project &gt; Build
  Working Set</b> menu becomes enabled. From here you are able to selectively build working sets of your choosing.</p>
  <div class="Note">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Newly created resources are not automatically included in the active working set. They
    are implicitly included in a working set if they are children of an existing working set element. If you want to
    include other resources after you have created them you have to explicitly add them to the working set.</p>
