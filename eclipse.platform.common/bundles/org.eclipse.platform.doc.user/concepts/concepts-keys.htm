  <h1>Keys</h1>
  <p>The function of the keyboard can be extensively customized in Eclipse using the <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Keys)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>General &gt; Keys</strong></a>
  preference page. Within Eclipse, key strokes and key sequences are assigned to invoke particular commands.</p>
  <h2>Key Strokes, Key Sequences, and Key Bindings</h2>
  <p>A 'key stroke' is the pressing of a key on the keyboard, while optionally holding down one or more of these
  modifier keys: <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Alt</code> (<code>⌥</code> on macOS), <code>Shift</code>, or <code>⌘</code>
  (only on macOS.) For example, holding down <code>Ctrl</code> then pressing <code>A</code> produces the key stroke
  <code>Ctrl+A</code>. The pressing of the modifier keys themselves do not constitute key strokes.</p>
  <p>A 'key sequence' is one or more key strokes. Traditionally, Emacs assigned two or three key stroke key sequences
  to particular commands. For example, the normal key sequence assigned to <code>Close All</code> in emacs is
  <code>Ctrl+X Ctrl+C</code>. To enter this key sequence, one presses the key stroke <code>Ctrl+X</code> followed by
  the key stroke <code>Ctrl+C</code>. While Eclipse supports key sequences of arbitrary lengths, it is recommended that
  keyboard shortcuts be four key strokes in length (or less).</p>
  <p>A 'key binding' is the assignment of a key sequence to a command.</p>
  <h2>Schemes</h2>
  <p>A 'scheme' is a set of bindings. Eclipse includes two schemes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Default</li>
    <li>Emacs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <em>Default</em> scheme contains a general set of bindings, in many cases recognizable as traditional key
  sequences for well known commands. For instance, <code>Ctrl+A</code> is assigned to <code>Select All</code>, and
  <code>Ctrl+S</code> is assigned to <code>Save</code>.</p>
  <p>The <em>Emacs</em> scheme contains a set of key bindings familiar to users of Emacs. For instance, <code>Ctrl+X
  H</code> is assigned to <code>Select All</code>, and <code>Ctrl+X S</code> is assigned to <code>Save</code>.</p>
  <p>The <em>Emacs</em> scheme is not a complete set of bindings like the <em>Default</em> scheme. Rather, it borrows 
  from the <em>Default</em> scheme where possible, only defining explicit Emacs-style bindings where they vary from the
  <em>Default</em> scheme. Generally, only well known commands like <code>Select All</code>, <code>Save</code>, etc.
  have specific Emacs key sequences associated with them.</p>
  <h2>Contexts</h2>
  <p>Key bindings can vary based on the current context of Eclipse.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the active part might be a Java file editor, for instance, where a different set of key sequence
  assignments may be more appropriate than if the active part was an html file editor. As a specific example, typically
  <code>Ctrl+B</code> is assigned to <code>Build</code> in a context such as Java file editing, while
  <code>Ctrl+B</code> is assigned to <code>Make Text Bold</code> in a context such as HTML file editing. This context
  is usually determined by the active part, but it can be influenced by the active window or dialog as well. If the
  active part does not choose a particular context, the workbench will set the active context to <em>In
  Windows</em>.</p>
  <p>Eclipse includes a number of different contexts. Some examples are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In Dialogs and Windows</li>
    <li>In Windows (extends In Dialogs and Windows)</li>
    <li>In Dialogs (extends In Dialogs and Windows)</li>
    <li>Editing Text (extends In Windows)</li>
    <li>Editing Java Source (extends Editing Text)</li>
    <li>Debugging (extends In Windows)</li>
    <li>Debugging Java (extends Debugging)</li>
    <li>In Console</li>
    <li>Editing Ant buildfiles<br>
    <br></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Contexts can extend other contexts. For example, the <em>Editing Java Source</em>
  context borrows key bindings from the <em>Editing Text</em> context, which in turn borrows key bindings from the
  <em>In Windows</em> context.</p>
  <p>Note: It is not recommended to promote a key binding to a context which it extends. For example, it is not
  recommended to move an <em>Editing Text</em> key binding to the <em>In Dialogs and Windows</em> context. This may
  have unexpected results.</p>
  <p>It is possible for some key bindings to work in dialogs. Those key bindings are assigned to the <em>In Dialogs and
  Windows</em> context. One example of such a key binding is the key binding for "cut". It is possible to change these
  key bindings. For example, it is possible to have Ctrl+X as cut in dialogs, but Ctrl+W as cut in windows.</p>
  <h2>Platform and Locale</h2>
  <p>Key bindings also vary by platform and locale. On the macOS platform, <code>⌘+S</code> is assigned to
  <code>Save</code>, instead of the usual <code>Ctrl+S</code>. On Chinese locales (zh), <code>Alt+/</code> is assigned
  to <code>Content Assist</code>, instead of the usual <code>Ctrl+Space</code>.</p>
  <p>The current platform and locale is determined when Eclipse starts, and does not vary over the course of an Eclipse
  instance.</p>
  <h2>The Dynamic Nature of Key Bindings</h2>
  <p>Key bindings are provided by plug-ins, and in Eclipse, plug-ins can be added or removed. This can cause key
  bindings declared by these plug-ins to be added or removed. Consider <code>CTRL+6</code> was assigned to the
  <em>About</em> command in the <em>Default</em> scheme. Say you install a new plug-in that assigns 
  <code>CTRL+6</code> to a particular command. Eclipse will preserve your assignment to <em>About</em>.</p>
  <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
  <p>There are only a finite number of simple, common key strokes available to assign to a multitude of commands. 
  Scheme, context, platform, and locale all partition key sequence assignments into domains where they
  don't conflict with one another. Consider the case for <code>Ctrl+B</code> key binding if contexts did not exist. One
  plug-in would assign <code>Ctrl+B</code> to <code>Build</code>, the other plug-in would assign <code>Ctrl+B</code> to
  <code>Make Bold Text</code>. How would Eclipse properly resolve this conflict?</p>
  <p>Though conflicts are drastically reduced by employing the above mechanisms, they can still occur. Two plug-ins,
  independent of one another, could assign the same key sequence to different commands with the same context, scheme,
  platform, and locale. Consider if a plug-in assigned <code>Ctrl+F4</code> in the <em>In Windows</em> context and
  <em>Default</em> scheme to one of its commands. This directly conflicts with Eclipse assigning <code>Ctrl+F4</code>
  to the <em>close</em> command in the same context and scheme.</p>
  <p>This is a conflict. Eclipse pop up the Key Assist Dialog with the conflicting commands and allow
  the user to select one. The <em>Key Assist</em> dialog is the same dialog that displays command choices for multiple key
  stroke key bindings.</p>
  <p>These types of conflicts can be resolved by explicitly assigning the key sequence to one of the commands, or
  remove it from the other.</p>
  <p>Another type of conflict can be caused by multiple-key stroke key sequences. For example, in the <em>Emacs</em>
  scheme, there are many multiple-key stroke key sequences beginning with the key stroke <code>Ctrl+X</code>.
  <code>Ctrl+X K</code> is assigned to <em>Close</em>. <code>Ctrl+X H</code> is assigned to <em>Select All</em>.</p>
  <p>As previously mentioned, the <em>Emacs</em> scheme borrows key bindings from the <em>Default</em> scheme. In the
  default scheme, <code>Ctrl+X</code> is assigned to <em>Cut</em>. Though the <em>Emacs</em> scheme doesn't
  explicitly redefine <code>Ctrl+X</code>, pressing <code>Ctrl+X</code> is required as part of many of its key
  bindings. In the <em>Emacs</em> scheme, when one presses <code>Ctrl+X</code>, one is half way to entering one of many
  possible assigned key sequences. One would not expect the <em>Cut</em> action to be invoked at this time.</p>
  <p>For this type of conflict, the rule is that the <code>Ctrl+X</code> key sequence assigned to <em>Cut</em>
  would be ignored. Otherwise, it would not be possible to complete many of the key bindings in the <em>Emacs</em>
  configuration.</p>
