  <h1>The Workbench</h1>
  <p class="Para">When the Workbench is launched, the first thing you see is a dialog that allows you to select where
  the workspace should be located. The workspace is the directory where your work will be stored. For now, just click
  OK to pick the default location.</p>
  <p>After the workspace location is chosen, a single Workbench window is displayed. A Workbench window offers one or
  more perspectives. A perspective contains editors and views, such as the Project Explorer. Multiple Workbench windows
  can be opened simultaneously. Initially, in the first Workbench window that is opened, the Java perspective is
  displayed, with only the Welcome view visible. Click the arrow labeled <b>Workbench</b> in the Welcome view to cause
  the other views in the perspective to become visible. Note you can get the Welcome view back at any time by selecting
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.quickStartAction")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Help &gt; Welcome</b></a>.</p>
  <p>A shortcut bar appears in the top right corner of the window. This allows you to open new perspectives and switch
  between ones already open. The name of the active perspective is shown in the title of the window and its item in the
  shortcut bar is highlighted.</p>
  <p>You should be seeing the Java perspective. We will switch to the simpler Resource perspective to simplify this
  tutorial. Select <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective(org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective.perspectiveId=org.eclipse.ui.resourcePerspective)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Open
  Perspective &gt; Other... &gt; Resource</b></a>. The Project Explorer, Outline, and Tasks views should now be
  visible.<br></p>
