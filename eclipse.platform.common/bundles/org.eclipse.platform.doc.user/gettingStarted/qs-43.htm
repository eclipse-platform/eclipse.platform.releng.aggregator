  <h1>Perspectives</h1>
  <p>A perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the Workbench window. One or more perspectives can
  exist in a single Workbench window.</p>
  <p>Perspectives can be opened in one of two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>In the same (existing) Workbench window.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In a new Workbench window.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Perspectives define visible action sets, which can be changed to customize a perspective. A perspective that is
  built in this manner can be saved, creating a custom perspective that can be opened again later.</p>
  <p>The Workbench window displays one or more perspectives. Each product determines initially what default perspective
  is displayed, in this example it is the Resource perspective. A perspective consists of views such as the Project
  Explorer as well as editors for working with resources. More than one Workbench window can be open at any given
  time.</p>
  <p>So far, only the Resource perspective (shown below) has been used in this tutorial. This section will explore how
  to open and work with other perspectives.</p>
  <p>A perspective provides a set of functionality aimed at accomplishing a specific type of task, or working with a
  specific type of resource.</p>
