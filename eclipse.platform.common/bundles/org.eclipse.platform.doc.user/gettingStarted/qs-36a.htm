  <h1>Starting a Search</h1>
  <p>Text strings can be searched for in the Workbench as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the Workbench toolbar, click the search button <img src="../images/search.svg" alt="Search button" border=
    "0">.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Containing text</b> field, type in: <i>it</i><br>
    The combo box for the <b>Containing text</b> field also displays a list of recently performed searches to select
    from.<br></li>
    <li>The <b>Case sensitive</b> checkbox can be selected or unselected depending on whether or not a case sensitive
    or insensitive search is to be performed. You can also select the <b>Regular expression</b> checkbox to enable more
    powerful searching capabilities. To see what is available in regular expression mode, you can hit Ctrl-Space over
    the text field to get content assistance that lists the possibilities. For this example, just check the <b>Case
    sensitive</b> box to search for lowercase "<i>it</i>".</li>
    <li>The kinds of files to include in the search can be specified in the <b>File name patterns</b> field. Click
    <b>Choose...</b> to open the Select Types dialog. This dialog provides a quick way to select from a list of
    registered extensions. For the moment, the search will be confined to .txt files. Ensure *.txt is checked and click
    <b>OK</b>.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Scope</b> field, specify the files and folders to include in the search. The choices are: the entire
    workspace, the currently selected resources in the Workbench, or a working set which is a named, customized group
    of files and folders. Leave the scope as workspace.</li>
    <li>Use the <b>Customize</b> button to choose what kinds of searches are available in the dialog. This setting may
    be left unchanged.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Search</b>. At this point, the Search view will be made visible, and it will begin to fill in with the
    results of the search. The stop button in the Search view can be clicked to cancel the search while it is in
    progress.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The next section will describe how to work with the Search view.</p>
