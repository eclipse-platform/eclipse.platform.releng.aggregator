  <h1>Copying</h1>
  <p class="Head">You can copy files to a folder using the following steps.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In one of the navigation views, select the .txt file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">From the file's context menu, select <b>Copy</b> (or Ctrl+C)</p>
    </li>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select another folder as the destination.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="Head">From the folder's context menu, select <b>Paste</b> (or Ctrl+V).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>As an alternative to copying files using the copy operation, it is also possible to copy files by holding down the
  Ctrl key while dragging a file from one folder to another folder. (On macOS, the ‚å• key is used for this.)</p>
  <p>Once the file has been copied it can be renamed.</p>
