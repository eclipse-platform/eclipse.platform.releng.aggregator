  <h1>Files</h1>
  <p class="Para">The projects, folders and files that you create with the Workbench are all stored under a single
  directory that represents your workspace. The location of the workspace was set in the dialog that first opens when
  you start the Workbench.</p>
  <p>If you have forgotten where that location is, you can find it by selecting <b>File &gt; Switch Workspace...</b>.
  The workspace directory will be displayed in the dialog that appears. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> After recording this
  location, hit <b>Cancel</b> to close the dialog, or the Workbench will exit and re-open on whatever workspace was
  selected.</p>
  <p class="Para">All of the projects, folders and files that you create with the Workbench are stored as normal
  directories and files on the machine. This allows the use of other tools when working with the files. Those tools can
  be completely oblivious to the Workbench. A later section will look at how to work with external editors that are not
  integrated into the Workbench.</p>
