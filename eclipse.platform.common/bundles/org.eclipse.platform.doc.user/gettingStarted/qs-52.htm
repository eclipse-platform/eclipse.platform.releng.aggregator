  <h1>Comparing</h1>
  <p class="Para">The Workbench allows for the comparison of multiple resources and for the presentation of the results
  in a special compare editor.</p>
  <p class="Para"><b>Setup</b></p>
  <p class="Para">Before commencing with compare a few files must be created. This will also be a good time to recap
  some of the basic features that have already been introduced.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Start by selecting all of the projects in one of the navigation views and deleting them by using
      <b>Delete</b> on the pop-up menu.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Create a new simple project using <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b>. Be sure to give the project
      a distinct name by typing unique name as the name of the new project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Use the project's pop-up menu to create a file called file1.txt.</p>
      <p class="Para">In the editor for file1.txt type the following lines of text and save the file:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="Para"><i>This is line 1.<br>
        This is line 2.<br>
        This is line 3.<br>
        This is line 4.<br>
        This is line 5.</i></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In one of the navigation views select file1.txt and use Ctrl+C to copy the file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Use Ctrl+V (Paste) to create the copy. In the name conflict dialog which appears, rename the file
      to file2.txt.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>(On the Mac, use ⌘+C and ⌘+V.)</p>
  <p>There are now two identical files, file1.txt and file2.txt.</p>
