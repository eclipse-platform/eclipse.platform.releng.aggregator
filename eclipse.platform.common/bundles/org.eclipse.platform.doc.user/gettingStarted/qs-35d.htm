  <h1>Moving</h1>
  <p class="Head">Having copied and renamed several of the resources, now it's time to move some resources around. The
  second folder and its file will be moved to be a sub-folder of the first folder.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the Project Explorer view, select the second folder.</li>
    <li>From the file's context menu, select <b>Move</b>.</li>
    <li>
      <p>In the Folder Selection dialog choose the first folder and click <b>OK</b>.</p>
      <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image48_move.png" width="620" alt="Folder dialog" border="0"></p>
    </li>
    <li>In the Project Explorer frist folder now contains the second one. Expand the second folder and confirm that it
    contains your .txt file.

    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>As an alternative to moving files using the move operation, it is also possible to move files by dragging a file
  from one folder to another folder. Remember that to copy files from one folder to the other, Ctrl needs to be held
  down while performing the drag and drop operation. (On macOS, the ‚å• key is used for this.)</p>
