  <h1>Searching</h1>
  <p>Text strings and files can be searched for in the Workbench in two different ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the <strong>Search Button</strong><img src="../images/search.svg" alt="Search button" border="0"> and
    Search view</li>
    <li>Using the Quick Text Search Dialog</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this section, we discuss both.</p>
  <p>First, we start showing how <strong>Search</strong> <img src="../images/search.svg" alt="Search button" border=
  "0"> can be used to perform a text search across the resources that are shown in the navigation view. Instruction
  will also be given on how to use the Search view to work with the results.</p>
  <p>Second, we will also explain how to use the <a href="qs-36c.htm">Quick Text Search</a> as an alternative to the
  standard search. The Quick Text Search is a popup dialog especially suited to find and jump to different places in
  your workspace quickly.</p>
