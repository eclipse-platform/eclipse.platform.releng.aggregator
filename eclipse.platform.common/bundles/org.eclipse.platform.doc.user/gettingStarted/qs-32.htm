  <h1>Deleting Resources</h1>
  <p class="Para">Now that a few files have been imported into the second project, here are instructions on how to
  delete the project.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Select your second project in one of the navigation views.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">To delete the project do one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From the project's pop-up menu choose <b>Delete</b></li>
        <li>Press the DEL key</li>
        <li>Choose <b>Edit &gt; Delete</b> from the pull-down menu</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">A prompt will ask for confirmation of the deletion and also what type of deletion should be
      performed.</p>
      <p class="Para">It is possible to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="Para">Delete the contents of the project from the file system</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="Para">Delete the project from the workspace but keep its contents in the file system</p>
        </li>
        <li>Accept the default (do not delete contents) and click <b>Yes</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only an option for projects. Files and folders are always deleted from the file
  system when deleted.</p>
  <p>The same steps work for any resource shown in the navigation view.<br></p>
