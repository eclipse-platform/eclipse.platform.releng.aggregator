  <title>Ant Buildfiles as Project Builders</title>

  <h1>Ant Buildfiles as Project Builders</h1>
  <p>Our second practical example of using Ant buildfiles in Eclipse is a 'project builder'. This is an Ant buildfile
  that has been designated to run whenever a project is built. The uses for such a buildfile are many:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate a <code>.jar</code> file containing class files from your project</li>
    <li>Perform some type of pre- or post-build processing on source or binary files in your project. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-processing source files to instrument them for performance analysis</li>
        <li>Obfuscating binary files to prevent reverse engineering</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Copy class files to some location (for instance, on a network)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For this example, we will create an Ant buildfile that creates a <code>.jar</code> archive of the class files in a
  project. Note that this is similar to the example in the last chapter, in which we used an Ant buildfile to generate
  <code>.jar</code> files for an Eclipse plug-in. This example differs in that it works for any Eclipse project,
  whether or not it is also an Eclipse plug-in.</p>
