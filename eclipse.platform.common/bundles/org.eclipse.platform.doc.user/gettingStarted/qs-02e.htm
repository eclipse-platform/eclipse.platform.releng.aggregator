  <h1>Views</h1>
  <p class="Para">The primary use of Views is to provide navigation of the information in the Workbench. For
  example:</p>
  <ul class="UnorderedList">
    <li class="Item">The Bookmarks view displays all bookmarks in the Workbench along with the names of the files with
    which the bookmarks are associated.</li>
    <li class="Item">The Project Explorer view displays the Workbench projects, their folders and files.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Para">A view might appear by itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.</p>
  <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image3_single.png" width="534" alt="Task View" border="0"></p>
  <p class="Para">To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook simply click its tab.</p>
  <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image3_tabbed.png" width="272" alt=
  "Two views with tabs, project explorer view active" border="0"></p>
  <p class="Para">Views have two menus. The first, which is accessed by right clicking on the view's tab, allows the
  view to be manipulated in much the same manner as the menu associated with the Workbench window.</p>
  <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image8_view.png" width="272" alt="Project Explorer view menu, top left" border=
  "0"></p>
  <p class="Para">The second menu, called the "view pull-down menu", is accessed by clicking the down arrow <img src=
  "../images/view_menu.svg" alt="View down arrow" border="0">. The view pull-down menu typically contains operations
  that apply to the entire contents of the view, but not to a specific item shown in the view. Operations for sorting
  and filtering are commonly found in the view pull-down.</p>
  <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image7_view_pulldown.png" width="550" alt=
  "Project Explorer view menu, arrow pulldown" border="0"></p>
  <p class="Para">A view can be displayed by selecting it from the <b>Window &gt; Show View</b> menu. A perspective
  determines which views may be required and displays these on the <b>Show View</b> sub-menu. Additional views are
  available by choosing <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.views.showView")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Other...</b></a> at the bottom of the <b>Show
  View</b> sub-menu. This is just one of the many features that provide for the creation of a custom work
  environment.</p>
  <p class="Para">Through the normal course of using the Workbench you will open, move, resize, and close views. If
  you'd like to restore the perspective back to its original state, you can select the <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt;
  Reset Perspective</b> menu operation.</p>
