  <h1>Importing Files</h1>
  <p class="Para">Files can be imported into the Workbench either by :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dragging and dropping from the file system, or</li>
    <li>copying and pasting from the file system, or</li>
    <li>Using the <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.file.import")'><img src=
    "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Import wizard</b></a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using drag and drop or copy/paste to import files relies on operating system support that is not necessarily
  available on all platforms. If the platform you are using does not have this support, you can always use the Import
  wizard.</p>
  <p class="Para">In this section the two files that were just exported will be imported and placed into the second
  project JaneQUser2.<br></p>
