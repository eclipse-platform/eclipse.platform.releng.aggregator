  <h1>Exiting the Workbench</h1>
  <p class="Para">Each time the Workbench is exited, the Workbench is automatically saved, including all open
  perspectives and windows. The next time the Workbench is reopened, it will appear exactly as it was when it was last
  closed.</p>
  <p>To exit the Workbench, select <b>File &gt; Exit</b> from the menu bar or close the workbench with the window close
  button (x). When the latter option is used a prompt will ask if you really wish to exit the workbench.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This dialog also presents an option to turn off the prompting. To turn it back on, open the
  <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog and choose the <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Startup)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>General &gt; Startup and
  Shutdown</strong></a> preferences page. Check the <b>Confirm exit when closing last window</b> checkbox.</p>
