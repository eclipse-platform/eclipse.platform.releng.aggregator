  <h1>Using the Popup</h1>
  <p class="Para">Now that we have our project we will create a folder. We will create our folder using the Project
  Explorer view's popup menu.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Activate the Project Explorer view and select the first project we created in the Project
      Explorer view. From the view's popup menu choose <b>New &gt; Folder</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the New Folder wizard, your project name appears by default in the <b>Enter or select the
      parent folder</b> field. This is because we chose to create the new folder from your project's context menu.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the <b>Folder name</b> field, type a unique name for your new folder. Depending on the
      operating system you are running on, some characters will not be allowed.</p>
      <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image14_new_folder_wizard.png" width="650" alt="New Folder Wizard" border=
      "0"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Click <b>Finish</b> when you are done. The Project Explorer view will update to show your newly
      created folder.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also an <b>Advanced &gt;&gt;</b> button. This button when selected allows you to
  enter a location outside of a project's hierarchy as the location for one of its folders. This is called a linked
  folder.</p>
