  <h1>The Search View</h1>
  <p>Now that the search has been completed, the Search view is visible. The title of the Search view shows that four
  matches were found.</p>
  <p class="Head">Within the Search view two files are shown and within each file there were 2 matches found.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the Show Next Match button <img src="../images/next_nav2.svg" alt="Show next match button" border="0"> to
    navigate to the first match of the search expression.<br>
    Notice that the corresponding file is automatically selected and opened in the editor area.<br>
    Click Show Next Match button two more times. Once again the Search view automatically opens the file.</li>
    <li>It is sometimes useful to remove uninteresting matches from the search results. The Search view's popup menu
    allows you to do this using <b>Remove Selected Matches</b> which removes any selected file entries (and all matches
    in them) from the Search view. Note that this <strong>only</strong> removes the entries in the Search view, it does
    <strong>not</strong> affect the files themselves. Select the corresponding entry in the Search view and choose
    <b>Remove Selected Matches</b> from the popup menu. The Search view now shows only the remaining matches.</li>
    <li>Perform a second search for another search term by clicking on the Search button <img src=
    "../images/search.svg" alt="Search button" border="0"> in the Workbench's toolbar.</li>
    <li>The Search view updates to show the results of the new search.<br>
    Use the drop down button on the Search view's toolbar to move back and forth between the two search results.</li>
    <li>In the drop down button choose the first search. The Search view switches back to show the original search. On
    the context menu choose <b>Search Again</b> to repeat the initial search.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>So far you have seen how to manage your search results and how to switch between different searches. However, it
  might happen that you do not want the search view to change even if further searches are performed. For this you can
  <strong>pin</strong> the search view, which causes subsequent searches to be shown in a second Search view.</p>
  <p>In the next section we will show how to use the Quick Text Search Dialog as an alternative to Search Dialog and
  Search View.</p>
