  <h1>Saving Perspectives</h1>
  <p class="Para">This tutorial has demonstrated how to add new views to the perspective and rearrange the views. The
  Workbench also allows this layout to be saved for future use.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the shortcut bar click on the Resource perspective. The Resource perspective is now
      active.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Drag the Outline view and stack it with one of the navigation views.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Save Perspective As...</b></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">The Save Perspective As dialog allows for an existing perspective to be redefined or for a new
      perspective to be created.</p>
      <p class="Para">Click <b>OK</b> to update the Resource perspective and <b>Yes</b> to the subsequent confirmation
      dialog. The new perspective layout will be used if the perspective is reset or if a new one is opened.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the Resource perspective move the Outline view so that it is now stacked with the Tasks
      view.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Reset Perspective</b>. Notice the Outline view is stacked
      with the navigation view. Originally when the Workbench was first started it was below the navigation view, but
      because the perspective was saved with the navigation view and Outline stacked, it now considers this its initial
      layout.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; New Window</b> to open a second window showing the resource perspective.
      Observe that it uses the newly saved layout.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Close the second window.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="Para">While the Resource perspective has been changed, there is a way to get back the original layout. To
  revert the Resource perspective to its original layout:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Open the <b>Preferences</b> dialog.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Expand <b>General</b> and select <b>Perspectives</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Select the <b>Resource</b> perspective and then click <b>Revert</b> on the right side.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Any changes to the saved state of the perspective has now been undone. To update the current copy
      of the Resource perspective that is being worked with, also choose <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Reset
      Perspective...</b> from the Workbench's menu bar.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
