  <h1>Simple Compare</h1>
  <p class="Head">In one of the navigation views select file1.txt and file2.txt choose <b>Compare With &gt; Each
  Other</b> from the context menu.</p>
  <p class="Head">A dialog will appear indicating that the two files are the same.</p>
  <p class="Head">Edit file1.txt as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>delete line 1 "<i>This is line 1."</i></li>
    <li>change line 3 to be "This is a much better line 3."</li>
    <li>insert a line 4a (before line 5) that reads "This is line 4a and it is new"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Head">The file (file1.txt) should now read as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>This is line 2.<br>
    This is a much better line 3.<br>
    This is line 4.<br>
    This is line 4a and it is new<br>
    This is line 5.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Save the contents of the file by choosing <b>File &gt; Save</b> (or pressing Ctrl+S).</p>
  <p>To compare the files, once again select file1.txt and file2.txt and choose <b>Compare With &gt; Each Other</b> in
  the navigation view context menu.</p>
  <p>A special compare editor opens. The next section will explain how to use this compare editor.</p>
