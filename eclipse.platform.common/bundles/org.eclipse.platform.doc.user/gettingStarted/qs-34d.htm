  <title>Editing Files Outside the Workbenc</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Editing Files Outside the Workbenc</h1>
  <p class="Para">In a previous section an external editor was launched on a .ini file by double clicking on it in the
  Project Explorer. The same external editor can also be used by launching it outside of the Workbench.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Close any editors that are open on the .ini file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the file system explorer, navigate to the directory where the Workbench was installed and go
      into the workspace sub-directory.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Edit the .ini file and save it. Do not use the Workbench's Project Explorer to open the
      editor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Return to the Workbench and in the Project Explorer view, select your project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Choose <b>Refresh</b> from the project's context menu. This instructs the Workbench to look for
      any changes to the project that have been made in the local file system by external tools.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Select the .ini file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">For a little variety choose <b>Open With &gt; Text Editor</b> from the file's popup menu.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Observe that the Workbench's own default text editor is opened.</p>
      <p class="Para">In the default text editor verify that the externally made changes are reflected in the
      Workbench.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Workbench stores all of its resources in the local file system. This means the system file explorer can be
  used to copy files from the Workbench's workspace area even when the Workbench is not running. Resources can also be
  copied into the workspace directory. Use Refresh to update the Workbench with any changes made outside the
  Workbench.</p>
