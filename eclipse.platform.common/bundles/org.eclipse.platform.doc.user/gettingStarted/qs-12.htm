  <h1>Navigating Resources</h1>
  <p class="Para">This section will work with the Project Explorer and Tasks views. These views are initially part of
  the resource perspective. To experiment with other views, they can be displayed by using the <b>Window &gt; Show
  View</b> menu.</p>
  <p class="Para">One important view to become familiar with is one of the navigation views, which displays information
  about the contents of the Workbench and how the resources relate to each other in a hierarchy.</p>
  <p class="Para">The Workbench contains projects, which in turn contain folders and/or files. Projects, folders, and
  files are collectively called resources.</p>
