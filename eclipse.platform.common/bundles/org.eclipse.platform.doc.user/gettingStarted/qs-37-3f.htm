  <h1>Removing Bookmarks</h1>
  <p class="Head">This section will demonstrate how to remove the bookmarks that have been created.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the Bookmarks view, select the second bookmark we created and do one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From the bookmark's context menu choose delete.</li>
        <li>Hit the Delete key on the keyboard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Para">Notice that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks view.</p>
    </li>
    <li>There should be one remaining bookmark. This bookmark is associated with a line in the same file. There are two
    other approaches to removing this bookmark.
      <ul>
        <li>Use <b>Remove Bookmark</b> in the marker bar of the editor. Remember, <b>Add Bookmark</b> was used in the
        marker bar when the bookmark was first created.<br></li>
        <li>Delete the bookmark (as was done above) by using <b>Delete</b> from the bookmark's popup menu in the
        Bookmarks view.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is the second approach.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Ensure there is an editor open on your file.</p>
      <p class="Para">Although the editor doesn't actually need to be open, the editor update will be viewable as the
      bookmark is deleted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Head">In the Bookmarks view, select your file (the remaining bookmark). Press the Delete key. Notice
      that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks view and the editor.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
