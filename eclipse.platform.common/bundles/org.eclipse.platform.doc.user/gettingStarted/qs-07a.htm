  <h1>A Simple Project</h1>
  <p class="Para">Now that the basic elements of the Workbench have been explained, here are some instructions for
  creating a simple project. New projects, folders, and files can be created using several different approaches. In
  this section resources will be created using three different approaches:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>File</b> menu</li>
    <li>Project Explorer's view context menu</li>
    <li>New Wizard button</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A project can be created using the <b>File</b> menu. Once the project has been created a folder and file can be
