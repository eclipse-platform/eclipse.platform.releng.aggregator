  <h1>Using the New Button</h1>
  <p class="Para">We have seen how to create resources using <b>File &gt; New</b> and <b>New</b> from the context menu
  of one of the navigation views. We will now create a file for our project using the third alternative, the toolbar
  <b>New</b> button.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Select the just created folder in one of the navigation views.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the Workbench window's toolbar, activate the drop-down menu on the New Wizard button <img src=
      "../images/new_wiz.svg" alt="New Wizard Button" border="0"> and select <b>File</b>. To activate the drop-down
      menu simply click on the down arrow.</p>
      <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image16_new_pulldown.png" width="258" alt="New Wizard Pulldown" border=
      "0"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the New File wizard, your folder's name and path already appear by default in the <b>Enter or
      select the parent folder</b> field. This is because you chose to create the new file while this folder was
      selected in one of the navigation views and the view was active.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the <b>File name</b> field, type a unique name for a new text file, including the .txt file
      extension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Click <b>Finish</b> when you are done.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">The Workbench has an editor capable of editing text files. A text editor is automatically opened
      on the newly created file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the text editor, type in the following five lines:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="Para"><i>This is a sample text file.<br>
        There is not much else<br>
        we can really say about it other<br>
        than it has five lines of<br>
        text that are rather dull.</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="Para">Notice that the editor tab has an asterisk (*) at the left of the filename. The asterisk
      indicates that the editor has unsaved changes.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image17b_unsaved_changes.png" width="575" alt="Editor Unsaved Changes"
        border="0"></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the Workbench window's toolbar, click the Save button <img src="../images/save_edit.svg" alt=
      "Save Button" border="0"> to save your work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In one of the navigation views ensure your folder is still selected and the navigation view is
      active.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Click <strong>New Wizard</strong> in the Workbench toolbar. Previously we clicked on the
      drop-down arrow of the New button. Here we clicked on the button itself which has the same effect as choosing
      <b>File &gt; New &gt; Other...</b></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the New wizard, select <b>General &gt; File</b>. Then click <b>Next</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Once again, your folder's name and path appears by default in the <b>Enter or select the parent
      folder</b> field.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">In the <b>File name</b> field, type a unique name for an .ini file. Click Finish when you are
      done.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">Since the Workbench does not have any editors registered for .ini files, it may launch an
      external editor on the file if one is registered with the operating system. For the moment, close the editor.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now that we have created our resources, one of the navigation views shows our two projects, the folder and its two
  files. To the right of one of the navigation views is the text editor open on the first file we created. To proceed
  with the following example create a second file.</p>
  <p>Click the editor tab of that newly created second file. Now select the .ini file in one of the navigation views.
  Then select the <b>Link with Editor</b> <img src="../images/synced.svg" alt="Link with Editor" border="0"> button in
  the local toolbar or view menu <img src="../images/view_menu.svg" alt="View Menu" border="0"> of one of the
  navigation views. Lastly, click on the editor tab for another file. Notice how the navigation view updated itself to
  select the file you are currently editing. If you don't like this automatic update you can easily turn it off by
  deselecting <b>Link with Editor</b>.</p>
