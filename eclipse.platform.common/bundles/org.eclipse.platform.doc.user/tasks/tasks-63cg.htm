  <h1>Copying Resources</h1>
  <p>You can copy resources from one Workbench location to another (for example, from one project to another
  project).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to copy.</li>
    <li>From the pop-up menu, select <b>Copy</b>.</li>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the project or folder where you want to copy the resources to.</li>
    <li>From the pop-up menu, select <b>Paste</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip:</em> You can also copy resources by holding down the Ctrl key and dragging them from the original
  location to the new location in one of the navigation views.</p>
  <p>Copying a linked resource always copies the link and not the resource that it is linked to. E.g., when copying a
  linked folder the folder contents is not copied on the file system. Instead, a new linked folder is created linking
  to the same location on the file system.</p>
