  <h1>Working With Patches</h1>
  <p>Patches allow developers to share work without storing it in a repository. This is helpful when a developer wants
  to contribute to a project that is shared through a repository but does not have write access to the repository. In
  this situation, the developer can create a patch and either e-mail it to a developer who does have write access or
  attach it to a bug in the bug reporting system used by the project, depending on the process defined by the project.
  A developer that does have write access can then apply the patch to the project and commit the changes.</p>
  <h2>To Create a Patch From a Project:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the resource that contains the modifications to be included in the patch. You can select resources that
    reside in multiple projects and at any level as the Create Patch wizard, when run in its default mode, knows how to
    create a multi-project patch. The patch should also be applied to the same file revisions that it is generated on
    so steps should be taken to ensure that the patch is applied to the same resource line-up (the easiest way to do
    this is to create the patch on top of a version).</li>
    <li>From the popup menu, select <b>Team &gt; Create Patch...</b>. The Create Patch wizard will open.</li>
    <li>Choose where the patch should be saved:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>Save to Clipboard</i> - this will place the patch on the clipboard so it can be pasted into a text
        editor such as an e-mail program.</li>
        <li><i>Save to File System</i> - this will place the patch in the specified file in the local file system</li>
        <li><i>Save in Workspace</i> - this will place the patch in the specified file inside one of the existing
        workbench projects.</li>
      </ol>For small patches it may be reasonable to transfer the patch using the clipboard but in most cases the local
      file system in the best option to use.
    </li>
    <li>You can preview and fine tune your patch selection by expanding the Resources tree presented in the Changes
    pane. Only those elements which are checked will be included in the patch. Click <b>Next</b> to configure how the
    patch is generated.</li>
    <li>Choose how to configure the patch:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>Diff output format</i> - Allows the choice of several common diff output formats. <i>Unified</i> is the
        format used by many patch application tools including Eclipse. The format used in Context and Unified diffs
        allows to apply a patch, even though the line number mentioned for the hunk (patch terminology) is incorrect.
        In this case, when applying the patch, the algorithm scans both forwards and backwards for a set of lines
        matching the context given for the hunk.</li>
        <li><i>Patch Root</i> - Allows you to specify at what level your patch is rooted at. The choices are
        <i>Workspace</i>, <i>Project</i> and <i>Selection</i>.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Workspace</i> allows you to include resources from multiple projects in your patch and is the
        <em>default</em> option. Workspace patches can be applied to any resource in the workspace - they contain
        enough information to allow the Apply Patch wizard to figure out which resources need to be patched.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Project</i> patches are rooted at the project level - which means they can only contain resources from one
        project and must be applied to the same project.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Selection</i> patches are rooted at whatever the selected resource is and must be applied to the same
        resource.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
    <li>Transfer the patch as appropriate for the project being patched.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>To Apply a Patch:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the resource that the patch was generated on. This resource should contain the same file revisions as
    the line-up on which the patch was generated.</li>
    <li>From the pop-up menu, select <b>Team &gt; Apply Patch...</b>. The Apply Patch wizard will open.<br>
    <br>
    This can also be achieved by copying the patch contents to the clipboard and pasting it directly into the Package
    Explorer view by choosing <b>Edit &gt; Paste</b>. In this case, you can skip the next step.</li>
    <li>Indicate where the patch is to be found:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>File</i> - the patch is in a file on the local file system. Either type in the full path to the file or
        use the <b>Browse...</b> button to find the file.</li>
        <li><i>Clipboard</i> - the patch is on the clipboard. <b>Warning:</b> It is safer to use a file based patch.
        Line endings may not be handled properly if the clipboard is used and the patch was generated on a different
        platform (i.e. Linux vs. Windows).</li>
        <li><i>URL</i> - the patch is located under the given URL. <b>Warning:</b> Make sure the URL you entered is
        valid and contains a proper patch. Otherwise you won't be able to apply it. Also, please keep in mind that
        applying a patch directly from a URL may take some time.</li>
        <li><i>Workspace</i> - the patch has been saved somewhere in the workspace.</li>
      </ol>Click <b>Next</b> to see the effect of applying the patch.
    </li>
    <li><b>Optional Step</b>: <i>this step applies, only if you have a patch rooted at the project or selection level -
    workspace rooted patches will automatically proceed to the Patch Preview Page.</i> In the Patch Target
    Specification page, you should select the resource that is to act as the root of the patch.</li>
    <li>The patch preview page shows whether the patch could be successfully applied to files in your workspace. The
    top pane shows the list of changes contained in your patch. There are two types of entries in the top pane: file
    changes and unmatched patch segments (known as 'hunk' in patch terminology).
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If one of more of the patch segments can be automatically applied to the file, the file will be shown with
        an incoming change indicator. You can inspect the change by double-clicking on the file.</li>
        <li>If one or more hunks cannot be automatically applied, the hunk entries will appear as children of the file
        in the top pane and a red exclamation mark indicates that there is a problem with a patch or hunk. You can
        inspect the hunk by double-clicking on it. You can then manually apply the hunk from the right pane to the file
        on the left. Saving from the left pane will update the parent file entry in the top pane but will not modify
        the file on disk. The file on disk is only modified when Finish is pressed. In order to apply the full patch
        successfully you will have to eliminate the problems (red exclamation marks) either by manually applying the
        patch segments, by excluding the patch segment from the operation by selecting <strong>Remove</strong> from the
        context menu or by tweaking the options on this wizard page (see 'Options' below).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If all is well, click <b>Finish</b> to apply the patch. The workspace will now contain outgoing changes for
    each file modified by the patch.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Patches can be applied by synchronizing them with a local content</p>
  <h3>To Synchronize With a Patch:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>From the Team Synchronizing perspective select the <strong>Synchronize...</strong> action from the Synchronize
    <img src="../images/synch_participants.svg" alt="" border="0"> button drop down.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Synchronize with Patch</strong> from the list of possible synchronization types and click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>Indicate where the patch is to be found:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>File</i> - the patch is in a file on the local file system. Either type in the full path to the file or
        use the <b>Browse...</b> button to find the file.</li>
        <li><i>Clipboard</i> - the patch is on the clipboard. <b>Warning:</b> It is safer to use a file based patch.
        Line endings may not be handled properly if the clipboard is used and the patch was generated on a different
        platform (i.e. Linux vs. Windows).</li>
        <li><i>URL</i> - the patch is located under the given URL. <b>Warning:</b> Make sure the URL you entered is
        valid and contains a proper patch. Otherwise you won't be able to apply the patch. Also, please keep in mind
        that applying a patch directly from a URL may take some time.</li>
        <li><i>Workspace</i> - the patch has been saved somewhere in the workspace.</li>
      </ol>Click <b>Next</b> to see the effect of applying the patch.
    </li>
    <li><b>Optional Step</b>: <i>this step applies, only if you have a patch rooted at the project or selection level -
    workspace rooted patches will automatically proceed to the Patch Preview Page.</i> In the Patch Target
    Specification page, you should select the resource that is to act as the root of the patch.</li>
    <li><b>Optional Step</b>: <i>this step applies, only if your patch refers to projects that are inaccessible - if
    all projects from the patch are present in the workspace and are open, this page will be skipped.</i> In the
    Inaccessible Projects page you can open any closed projects. Moreover, details about non-existing projects will be
    displayed. Projects that are closed or do not exist in the workspace cannot be patched.</li>
    <li>On the final page, click <b>Finish</b> to preview patch changes in the Synchronize view.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Options for Applying a Patch</h3>For getting successful matches of your patch file you have the following
  options:
  <ol>
    <li>Go back to the first page of the Apply Patch wizard and select the correct resource to which the patch should
    be applied.</li>
    <li>If a common prefix of the path names stored in the patch file doesn't match the path names in you current
    workspace, you can <i>Ignore leading path name segments</i>.</li>
    <li>Use the <i>Ignore whitespace</i> button to make the matching process independent from whitespace differences
    between the patch file and files in your workspace.</li>
    <li>Adjust the <i>Fuzz factor</i> (patch terminology). This factor indicates the amount of hunk context lines to
    ignore. If the Fuzz factor value is zero all lines need to match. If the fuzz factor is greater than zero, for
    example 2, the first two context lines before the hunk and the last two context lines after the hunk are ignored.
    Click <b>Guess</b> to calculate the fuzz factor that allows the most hunks to be matched.</li>
    <li>Use the <i>Reverse patch</i> option for patch files that already have been applied to your workspace. This
    option is also useful to undo or redo a patch.</li>
    <li>For Workspace patches, you can select another project in your workspace to apply the patch changes to. To do
    this, select a project in the top pane and select <b>Move</b> from the context menu. This will launch a dialog with
    a list of all available projects in your workspace. Select a project and click <b>OK</b>; the patch changes will be
    applied to your selected project.</li>
    <li>Use the <i>Show Excluded</i> option to show the hunks which you have already selected to not include in the
    patch.</li>
    <li>When synchronizing with a patch, the options above are available in the Synchronize View's pull down menu. You
    can also switch between available models to get extra information about the changes being applied.</li>
