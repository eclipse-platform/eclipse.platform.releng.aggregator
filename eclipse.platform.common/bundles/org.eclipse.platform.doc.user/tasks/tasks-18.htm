  <h1>Linking the Project Explorer View to the Active Editor</h1>
  <p>When you have multiple files open for editing, you can configure one of the navigation views to automatically
  bring an open file to the foreground (make its editor session the active editor) every time you select that open file
  in one of the navigation views. There are two ways to set this.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the Project Explorer menu, select <b>Link With Editor.</b></li>
    <li>Click on the Link With Editor icon <img src="../images/synced.svg" alt="Link with editor icon"> on one of the
    navigation bars.</li>
  </ol>
