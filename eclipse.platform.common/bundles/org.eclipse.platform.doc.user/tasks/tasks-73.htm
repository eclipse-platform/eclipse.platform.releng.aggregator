  <h1>Building Resources</h1>
  <p>There are a number of ways that resources in the Workbench can be built. The scope of a build can be one or more
  selected projects, a working set, or the entire workspace.</p>
  <p>A build will typically only operate on resources that have changed since the last build. A clean build will
  discard all existing built state, causing the next build to operate on all resources within the scope of the
  build.</p>
  <p>Builds can be done automatically (each time resources are modified), or manually, using a menu item or keyboard
  shortcut. See the Related tasks links for more details.</p>
