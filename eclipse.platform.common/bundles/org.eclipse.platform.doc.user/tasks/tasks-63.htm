  <h1>Moving Resources</h1>
  <p>You can move resources from one Workbench location to another (for example, from one project to another
  project).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to move.</li>
    <li>From the pop-up menu, select <b>Move</b>.</li>
    <li>In the Move Resources window, select the project or folder where you want to move the resources to and click
    <b>OK</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip:</em> You can also move resources by dragging them from the original location to the new location in one
  of the navigation views.</p>
  <p>Moving a linked resource always moves the link and not the resource that it is linked to. E.g., when moving a
  linked folder the folder contents is not moved on the file system.</p>
