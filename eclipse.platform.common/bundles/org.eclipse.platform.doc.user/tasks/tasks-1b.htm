  <h1>Working With Views and Editors</h1>
  <p>Views and editors are the main visual entities which appear in the Workbench. In any given perspective there is a
  single editor area, which can contain multiple editors, and a number of surrounding views which provide context.</p>
  <p>The Workbench provides a number of operations for working with views and editors. See the Related tasks links for
  more details.</p>
