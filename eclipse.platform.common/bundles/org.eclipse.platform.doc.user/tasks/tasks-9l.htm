  <h1>Detaching Views and Editors</h1>
  <p>Detached views and editors are shown in a separate window with a smaller trim. They work like other views and
  editors except they they are always shown in front of the Workbench window.</p>
  <p>To detach a view:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the Workbench window is maximized, resize it so that it does not fill the entire screen.</li>
    <li>Click the title bar of the view that you want to detach. Hold the mouse button down.</li>
    <li>Drag the view outside of the Workbench window and release the mouse button. You can also drag the view into the
    window of a previously detached view to have multiple detached views together.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To restore the view to be shown inside of the Workbench window, drag the view tab into the Workbench window.</p>
  <p>The same procedure can be followed to detach and restore editors.</p>
