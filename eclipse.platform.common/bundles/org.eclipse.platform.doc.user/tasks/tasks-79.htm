  <h1>Filtering the Tasks and Problems Views</h1>
  <p>You can filter the tasks or problems that are displayed in the Tasks or Problems views. For example, you might
  wish to see only problems that have been logged by the Workbench, or tasks that you have logged as reminders to
  yourself. You can filter items according to which resource or group of resources they are associated with, by text
  string within the Description field, by problem severity, by task priority, or by task status.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the view menu of the Tasks or Problems view, select <b>Filters...</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the radio buttons and checkboxes that correspond to your filtering objectives.</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  </ol>
