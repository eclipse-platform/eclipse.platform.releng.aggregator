  <h1 class="Head">Setting the Content Type of a File Extension</h1>
  <p class="Para">Team repositories distinguish between files that contain ASCII data and those that do not. For ASCII
  files, additional helpful functionality is available. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proper end of line conversion between the client and the server. This ensures that a Windows user and a UNIX
    user can work on the same file without introducing incompatibilities.</li>
    <li>Auto merging of conflicts. If a file contains both incoming and outgoing changes but none on the same line as
    another, then the file may be automatically merged when updating.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Para">Certain file types invariably contain either ASCII data or binary data. For example, *.txt files
  usually contain ASCII data, and *.exe files usually contain binary data. Eclipse comes with a pre-defined set of file
  types, which you may add to or modify.</p>
  <p class="Para">To set the content type associated with a file extension:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the <a class="command-link" href=
    'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.team.ui.TextPreferences)")'>
    <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Team &gt; File Content</b></a>
    preference page. This page displays a list of file extensions and content type (ASCII or Binary) for file
    extensions whose content type is known.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="Para">To add a file extension, click the <b>Add Extension</b> button and enter the file extension in
      the text prompt that appears. Once <b>OK</b> is clicked, the extension will be added to the list with a content
      type of ASCII.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change the content type for an existing file extension, select the file extension entry and click the
    <b>Change</b> button. This will toggle the type from ASCII to Binary or vice versa.</li>
    <li>To remove a file extension, select the file extension entry and click the <b>Remove</b> button.<br></li>
  </ol>
