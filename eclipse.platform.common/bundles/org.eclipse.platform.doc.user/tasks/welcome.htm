  <h2>Customizing Welcome</h2>
  <p>The welcome appearance can be customized via the "customize page" button above the welcome page. This opens a
  customize dialog which allows you to select one of the pre-defined themes, which affects the overall look of the
  welcome. You can also select which pages will be displayed, and the visibility, layout, and priority of the items
  within each page.</p>
  <p>For more information about customizing welcome, see the <a href="../reference/welcome_preferences.htm">reference
  documentation</a> for the customize welcome dialog.</p>
