  <h1>Rearranging Tabbed Views</h1>
  <p>In addition to dragging and dropping (docking) views inside the Workbench, you can rearrange the order of views
  within a tabbed notebook.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the tab of the view that you want to move and drag it to where you want it. A stack symbol
    <img border="0" src="../images/drop_stack.svg" alt="drop stack image"> appears as you drag the view across other
    view tabs.</li>
    <li>Release the mouse button when you have the view tab in the desired location. The view that you selected is now
    moved.</li>
  </ol>
