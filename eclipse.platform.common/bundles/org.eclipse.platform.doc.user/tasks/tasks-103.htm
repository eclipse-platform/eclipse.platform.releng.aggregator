  <h1 class="Head">Replacing resources in the Workbench</h1>
  <p>To replace Workbench resources with versions in the repository:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a resource in one of the navigation views.</li>
    <li>From the resource's pop-up menu, select one of the following menu items:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Replace With &gt; Latest From &lt;Branch Name&gt;</b> or <strong>&lt;Version&gt;</strong> - replace the
        Workbench resource with the latest resources currently committed to the branch that the local project is shared
        with or if the local project is checked out as a version then replace with the same version.</li>
        <li><b>Team &gt; Revert to Base</b> - replace the Workbench resource with the last checked out revision.
        Deleted files are restored.</li>
        <li><b>Replace With &gt; Another Branch or Version</b> - replace the Workbench resource with a specific version
        or branch that you select in the repository. When you select this option, another window opens, so that you can
        browse through the branch and version tags in the repository and select the one that you want.</li>
        <li><b>Replace With &gt; History...</b> - (available only on a file) replace the Workbench file with another
        revision of the file. Based on your preference settings, either the History view or a dialog will open. The
        History view (or dialog) will contain a table of all available revisions of the selected file. Selecting one of
        the revisions will show the differences between the workspace revision and the selected revision. To replace
        the workspace revision, you should select the revision that you want and choose 'Get Contents' from the context
        menu. This will replace the contents of the workspace file with those of the selected revision.</li>
        <li><strong>Team &gt; Switch to Another Branch or Version</strong> - this update will replace Workbench
        resources with those on the tag specified in the Update dialog. The behavior differs from the above replace
        operations in that uncommitted modifications in the Workbench are not replaced but instead are "moved" to the
        resources from the selected tag.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip</em>: When replacing with a branch or version or when updating, you can specify a particular date instead
  of a a version or branch tag. This can be done by right clicking on the <strong>Dates</strong> category in the tag
  selection list and choosing <strong>Add Date</strong>. A Date Tag dialog is displayed that allows you to specify a
  date and optionally a time. After you click <strong>Ok</strong>, the date tag will appear in the tag selection
  list.</p>
