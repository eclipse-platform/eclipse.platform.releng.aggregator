  <h1>Deleting Resources</h1>
  <p>To delete a resource from the Workbench:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to delete. (Hold down the Ctrl key to select
    more than one resource.)</li>
    <li>Press the Delete key.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Yes</b> in the dialog which appears.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip:</em> You can achieve the same result by selecting <b>Delete</b> from the pop-up menu.</p>
  <p>Deleting resources from the workspace will also delete the corresponding files and/or folders from the local file
  system. The only exception is linked resources, which are not removed from the file system when you delete the link
  in the workspace. However, deleting child resources of linked folders <em>will</em> delete those resources from the
  local file system.</p>
  <p>In most cases it is possible to undo a resource delete, which will restore deleted files from the local history.
  The files can also be restored manually from the history. See the related tasks for more details.</p>
