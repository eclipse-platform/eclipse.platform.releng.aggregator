  <h2>Using Help Scopes</h2>
  <p>Help scopes allow you to restrict the scope of a search and limit the topics which show in help contents. In the
  help view help the active scope only affects search results, in the help browser it also affects the table of
  contents and keyword index. A scope can be defined to include only specific books or topics from the table of
  contents. If the documentation set has been configured to allow scoping by criteria it is possible also to define
  scopes which satisfy specific criteria such as "platform" = "linux".</p>
  <h3>Defining a Topic Based Scope in Help Contents</h3>
  <p>From help contents the scope is changed by clicking on the link labelled "Scope" next to the search type in
  area.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/help_scope_link.png" alt="Scope selection link." border="0" /></p>
  <p>This opens a scope selection dialog, click "New ..." to create a new scope.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/help_scope_select.png" alt="Scope selection dialog." border="0" /></p>
  <p>This opens a new scope dialog which allow you to select which topics to show. If the documentation set does not
  support scoping by criteria the dialog will be similar to the one below, in this case only the topics in the
  Workbench Users Guide will be shown.</p>

  <h3>Defining a Scope Using Criteria</h3>If the documentation has been set up to allow for scoping using criteria an
  additional set of checkboxes is displayed to the right of the topic selection area. In the screen shot below the
  documentation set has two criteria which can be used to define a scope, platform and version. In this example the
  scope would include all topics which were in the one of the two books on Java Development and which were identified
  by the documentation writer as being applicable to Windows or Linux.
