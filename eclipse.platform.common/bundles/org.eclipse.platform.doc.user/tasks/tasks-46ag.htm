  <h1 class="Head">Finding a Resource Quickly</h1>
  <p>To navigate to a particular resource in a view such as the Project Explorer view:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From <b>Navigate</b> menu, select <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b>.</li>
    <li>In the window that opens, start typing the name of the resource in the <b>Pattern</b> field. As you type the
    file name, the system offers a list of possible matches, based on what you have entered so far.</li>
    <li>Select the resource that you want from the <b>Matching Items</b> list, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The view displays the selected resource.</p>
  <p>If you want to open a particular resource in an editor rather than select it in a view, you can use the <a class=
  "command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.navigate.openResource")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Navigate &gt; Open Resource</b></a> action.
  This action presents the same dialog as the <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b> action, but immediately opens the matching
  resource for editing.</p>
  <p>You can also do a contextual search for character strings contained within files in the Workbench. See the links
  to related tasks below.</p>
