  <h1>Installation Details for Features</h1>
  <p>You can browse detailed information about the individual features that compose your installation. This view is
  useful when the list of installed software does not provide enough detail. For example, you may have installed a
  particular feature that required some other features. At times you want to know exactly which versions of which
  features are installed into your system without having to know what installed software item required that feature. To
  browse the feature details:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click <b>Help &gt; About</b> and then click <a class="command-link" href=
    'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.installationDialog")'><img src=
    "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Installation Details...</b></a> to open a
    dialog showing pages that provide more detail about your installation.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Features</b> tab to see a list of the features that are installed in your configuration. The list
    includes each feature's name, provider, id, and version.</li>
    <li>Select a feature to see additional detail.
      <ul>
        <li>Click <b>License</b> to launch a browser that shows the feature's license.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Plug-in Details</b> to open a dialog that lists all of the plug-ins provided as part of the
        feature.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
