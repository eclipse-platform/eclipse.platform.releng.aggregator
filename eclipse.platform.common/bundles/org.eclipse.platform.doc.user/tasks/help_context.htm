  <h2>Accessing Context-Sensitive Help</h2>
  <p>To access the context-sensitive help for a given widget:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the widget by putting focus on it (see the table below).</li>
    <li>Press the <strong><code>F1</code></strong> key (<strong><code>Shift+F1</code></strong> on Linux,
    <strong><code>Help</code></strong> on the Mac). Or, in dialogs, click on the <img src="../images/help.svg" alt=
    "Help button"> <strong>Help</strong> icon in the button bar.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This displays a description of the selected widget, and usually, a list of links to related information, in the
  help view. If you want more information than what is shown in the description, click a link to one of the related
  topic, or one of the search results appearing in the dynamic help section in the help view.</p>
  <p>Depending on help preference settings, requesting context-sensitive help may display context help in an
  <em>infopop</em> instead of help view. You can dismiss the infopop by clicking outside it, or by pressing
  <code>Esc</code>.</p>
  <p>If you want more information than what is shown in the infopop, click a link to the related information. This
  opens the Help browser to the selected topic and closes the infopop. The list of related links stays in the left hand
  frame, so you do not have to press <code>F1</code> again if you are interested in other topics related to the same
  widget.</p>
  <p>To access context sensitive help for a widget, you must put focus on it and then press <code>F1</code>. The
  following table shows how to put focus on some of the different kinds of widgets.</p>
  <table style="width:70%">
	<caption>Widget selection table</caption>
    <tr>
      <th>Widget type</th>
      <th>How to select it</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Menu item (for example <strong>Save</strong> in the <strong>File</strong> menu)</td>
      <td>Let your mouse pointer rest over it so that it is highlighted, but don't click on it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Field</td>
      <td>Put the cursor in the field.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Button (for example <b>Cancel</b> button on a Dialog)</td>
      <td>Tab until the button is in focus.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>List</td>
      <td>Click an item in the list.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>View or pane</td>
      <td>Click the title bar of the View or pane.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>checkbox</td>
      <td>Click the checkbox (which changes its state) or use the Tab key to bring it into focus.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><em>Note:</em> Context-sensitive help is unavailable for toolbar buttons. Instead, let your mouse pointer hover
  over a toolbar button to view tooltip help for buttons.</p>
