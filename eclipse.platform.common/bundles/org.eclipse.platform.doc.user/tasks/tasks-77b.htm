  <h1>Associating a Task With a Resource</h1>
  <p>You can associate tasks with an editable resource, for instance to remind yourself to update a line of source code
  later.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, double-click the resource with which you wish to associate the new task. The
    resource opens in the editor area.</li>
    <li>Right-click in the gray border at the left of the editor area, beside the line of text or source code against
    which you want to log the new task.</li>
    <li>On the pop-up menu, select <b>Add Task</b>.</li>
    <li>When prompted, enter a brief description of the task.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A new task icon appears in the border of the editor area, to the left of the line where you added the task. When
  you move the mouse pointer over the marker, the description of the task is displayed as a tooltip. The task is also
  added to the Tasks view. You can delete a task either by right-clicking its icon in the editor area and selecting
  <b>Remove Task</b>, or by pressing the Delete key in the Tasks view.</p>
