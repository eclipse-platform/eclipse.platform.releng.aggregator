  <h1>Reverting to a Previous Install Configuration</h1>
  <p>As you install, upgrade, and uninstall software into your system, configuration snapshots are kept in a history.
  Reverting to a previous configuration allows you to back out of the results of an unsuccessful install, upgrade, or
  uninstall. To revert to a saved configuration:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click <b>Help &gt; About</b> and then click <a class="command-link" href=
    'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.installationDialog")'><img src=
    "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Installation Details...</b></a> to open a
    dialog showing pages that provide more detail about your installation.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Installation History</b> tab to see a list of previously saved configurations. Selecting each
    configuration will show you what was installed in that configuration. When you have found the configuration to
    which you want to revert, click <b>Revert</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the Workbench for the changes to take effect.</li>
    <li>When you restart, you should see that the <b>Installed Software</b> page list matches the configuration that
    you chose.</li>
