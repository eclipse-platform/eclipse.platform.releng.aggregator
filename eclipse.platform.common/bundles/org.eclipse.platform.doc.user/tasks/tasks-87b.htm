  <h1>Restoring Deleted Resources From Local History</h1>
  <p>To restore a deleted Workbench resource with a state from the local history:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the folder or project into which you want to restore a local history
    state.</li>
    <li>From the resource's pop-up menu, select <b>Restore from Local History...</b>. The Restore From Local History
    dialog opens showing all files that were previously contained in the selected folder or project and all of their
    sub-folders.</li>
    <li>Check the files that you want to restore</li>
    <li>If you don't want to restore just the last state of a file you can select any other state of the file from the
    <b>Local History</b> list on the right hand side of the dialog. The bottom pane of the dialog shows the contents of
    the state.</li>
    <li>If you are done with all files click <b>Restore</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip</em>: You can configure your Workbench preferences to specify how many days to keep files, or how many
  entries per file you want to keep, or the maximum file size for files to be kept with the <a class="command-link"
