  <h1>Working With Projects, Folders and Files</h1>
  <p>There are three different types of resources in the workbench: projects, folders, and files. Projects are the
  largest structural unit used by the Workbench. Projects contain folders and files, and they can be opened, closed, or
  built. Folders can contain other folders and files. The Workbench provides a number of mechanisms for working with
  projects, folders and files. See the related tasks section for more details.</p>
  <p>Folders and files can be linked to locations in the file system outside of the project's location. These special
  folders and files are called <a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">linked resources</a>.</p>
