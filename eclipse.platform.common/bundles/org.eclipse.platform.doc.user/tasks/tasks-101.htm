  <title>Comparing Resources With Repository Versions</title>

<body>
  <h1>Comparing Resources With Repository Versions</h1>
  <p>To compare Workbench resources with those in the repository:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a resource in one of the navigation views.</li>
    <li>From the resource's pop-up menu, select one of the following menu items:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Compare With &gt; Latest From &lt;Branch Name&gt;</b> or <strong>&lt;Version&gt;</strong>- Compare the
        Workbench resource with the latest resources currently committed to the branch that the local project is shared
        with or if the local project is checked out as a version then compare against the version. A compare editor
        will be opened. This editor will display a tree of all resource differences between the workspace resource and
        the latest resources in the repository.</li>
        <li><b>Compare With &gt; Another Branch or Version</b> - Compare the Workbench resource with a specific version
        or branch that you select in the repository. A compare editor will be opened. The editor will display a tree of
        all resource differences between the workspace resource and the resources in the specified version or
        branch.</li>
        <li><b>Compare With &gt; History...</b> - (available only on a file) Compare the Workbench file with another
        revision of the file. Based on your preference settings, either the History view or a dialog will open. The
        History view (or dialog) will contain a table of all available revisions of the selected file. Selecting one of
        the revisions will show the differences between the workspace revision and the selected revision.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Tip</em>: When comparing with a branch or version, you can specify a particular date instead of a version or
  branch tag. This can be done by right clicking on the <strong>Dates</strong> category in the tag selection list and
  choosing <strong>Add Date</strong>. A Date Tag dialog is displayed that allows you to specify a date and optionally a
  time. After you click <strong>Ok</strong>, the date tag will appear in the tag selection list.</p>
