  <h1 class="Head">Merging Changes in the Compare Editor</h1>
  <p>The toolbar buttons in the compare editor allows you to merge changes from the left file to the right file and
  vice versa. There are four types of merges you can perform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy All from Left to Right</li>
    <li>Copy All from Right to Left</li>
    <li>Copy Current Change from Left to Right</li>
    <li>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <b>Copy All from Left to Right</b> and <b>Copy All from Right to Left</b> actions completely replace the
  contents of one resource with the other resource.</p>
  <p>To merge a single change:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the highlighted difference that you want to merge.</li>
    <li>Depending on what you want to do, click either the <b>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</b> or the <b>Copy
    Current Change from Left to Right</b> toolbar button. The selected text is copied from one file to the other.</li>
    <li>Right click to get the resource's pop-up menu, and select <b>Save</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The image below gives an example of two files (file1.txt and file2.txt) compared.</p>
