  <h1>Closing Projects</h1>
  <p>When a project is closed, it can no longer be changed in the Workbench and its resources no longer appear in the
  Workbench, but they do still reside on the local file system. Closed projects require less memory. Also, since they
  are not examined during builds, closing a project can improve build time.</p>
  <p>To close a project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the project in one of the navigation views.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Close Project</b> on the pop-up menu.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To re-open the project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the project in one of the navigation views.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Open Project</b> on the pop-up menu.</li>
  </ol>
