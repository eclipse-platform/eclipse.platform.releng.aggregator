  <h1>Performing Builds Manually</h1>
  <p>By default, builds are performed automatically when you save resources. If you need more control over when builds
  occur, you can disable automatic building and manually invoke builds. This is sometimes desirable in cases where you
  know building should wait until you finish a large set of changes. The disadvantage of manual building is that tasks
  generated to indicate build errors quickly become out of date until you build. In addition, it is very important that
  you remember to manually build before relying on build output (for example, before running your Java program).</p>
  <p><em>Note:</em> Some of the menu items described below are only available when the automatic build preference is
  disabled (ensure <b>Project &gt; Build Automatically</b> is not checked).</p>
  <p>To build projects in the workspace select the projects and click <b>Project &gt; Build Project</b>. Alternatively,
  click <b>Project &gt; Build All</b> to build all projects in the workspace. Both of these commands will search
  through the projects and only build the resources that have changed since the last build. To build all resources,
  even those that have not changed since the last build, run <b>Project &gt; Clean...</b> before doing the build.</p>
