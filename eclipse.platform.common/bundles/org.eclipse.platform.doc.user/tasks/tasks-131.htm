  <h1>Installation Details for Plug-ins</h1>
  <p>You can browse detailed information about the individual plug-ins that compose your installation. This view is
  useful when the list of installed software or the feature detail is not enough. At times you want to know exactly
  which versions of which plug-ins are installed into your system, without having to know what feature contained the
  plug-in. To browse the plug-in details:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click <b>Help &gt; About</b> and then click <a class="command-link" href=
    'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.installationDialog")'><img src=
    "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Installation Details...</b></a> to open a
    dialog showing pages that provide more detail about your installation.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Plug-ins</b> tab to see a list of the plug-ins that are installed in your configuration. The list
    includes each plug-in's name, provider, id, and version.</li>
    <li>Select a plug-in to see additional detail.
      <ul>
        <li>Click <b>Legal Info</b> to launch a browser that shows any legal information that may be provided with the
        plug-in.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Show Signing Info</b> to view information about the signing certificate provided with the
        plug-in.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The search field at the top of the dialog allows you to search by plug-in name or id. Simply start typing to start
  filtering. The icon at the edge of the search field will clear the search and allow all plug-ins to show up.</p>
