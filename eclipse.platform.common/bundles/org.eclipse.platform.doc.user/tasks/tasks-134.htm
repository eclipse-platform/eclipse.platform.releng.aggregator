  <h1>About Your Installation</h1>
  <p>The <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.aboutAction")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Help &gt; About Eclipse SDK</b></a> dialog
  summarizes information about your installation. This is useful when reporting bugs or problems with your setup. The
  detailed id of the build is shown, along with copyright information.</p>
  <p>Underneath the product summary information is a row of buttons. If you have not installed any additional features
  or plug-ins into your setup, you'll see only one button with the Eclipse logo. Clicking the button will open a dialog
  that shows information about the Eclipse features in your setup. If you have installed additional features from other
  sources, you'll see additional buttons, one for each software provider. Clicking each provider's button will show the
  features from that provider.</p>
  <p>To get detailed information about the installation, click the <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.installationDialog")'><img src=
  "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>Installation Details...</b></a> button. This
  will open a dialog showing pages that provide more detail about different aspects of your installation.</p>
