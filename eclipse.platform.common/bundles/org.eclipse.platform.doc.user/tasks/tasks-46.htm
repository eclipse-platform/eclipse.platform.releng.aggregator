  <h1>Opening Files for Editing</h1>
  <p>You can launch an editor for a given file in several ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By right-clicking the file in one of the navigation views and then selecting <b>Open</b> from the pop-up
    menu.</li>
    <li>By double-clicking the file in one of the navigation views.</li>
    <li>By double-clicking a bookmark that is associated with that file, in the Bookmarks view.</li>
    <li>By double-clicking an error or warning, or task record that is associated with that file, in the Problems
    view.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of the above alternatives open the file in the default editor for that type of file. To open it in a different
  editor, select <b>Open With</b> from the file's pop-up menu.</p>
