  <h1 class="Head">Editor Area</h1>
  <p class="Intro">The editor area is where you modify the contents of files in the Workbench.</p>
  <p class="Para">Here is what the editor area looks like when multiple files are open and a text file is being
  edited:</p>

    <h2>Marker Bar</h2>
    <p class="Para">The marker bar is the vertical bar located at the left of the editor area.</p>
    <p class="Para">Here is what the marker bar looks like:</p>
    <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image231_marker_bar.png" alt="Marker Bar" border="0"></p>
    <h2>Markers</h2>
    <p class="Para">Markers are displayed in the marker bar, to the left of the text editor.</p>
    <p class="Para">Depending on the type of file displayed in the editor area, three kinds of markers may be
    displayed:</p>
    <ul class="UnorderedList">
      <li class="Item">Bookmarks</li>
      <li class="Item">Task markers (for associated tasks)</li>
      <li class="Item">Debugging breakpoints</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Para">You can create and associate a marker with a specific line in a file by accessing the context menu
    from the marker bar, which is directly to the left of that line.</p>
    <p class="Para">Here is what the context menu of the marker bar for a java editor looks like:</p>

    <h2>Types of Editors</h2>
    <p class="Para">The Workbench uses three types of editors:</p>
    <ul class="UnorderedList">
      <li class="Item">Internal: These editors are launched inside the editor area in the Workbench window.</li>
      <li class="Item">External: You can go outside the Workbench in the file system, edit a Workbench file outside the
      Workbench, and save the edited file. For example, imagine that you add an SGML file to the Workbench. Later, you
      go into the file system and open the file in an SGML editor, then save the file. The edited SGML file is still
      represented in the Workbench, even though you did not edit the file in the Workbench. If you associate a file
      type with an external editor in the Workbench ( <a class="command-link" href=
      'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.FileEditors)")'>
      <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <b>General &gt; Editors &gt; File
      Associations</b></a> preference page), then the Workbench will launch this external editor.</li>
      <li class="Item">ActiveX: On Microsoft Windows platforms, the Workbench makes use of ActiveX controls for
      applications that allow for them. For example, Microsoft Word supports being embedded as an OLE document. Thus if
      you have a <i>.doc</i> file in the Workbench, and Word is registered as the editor for <i>.doc</i> files in your
      operating system, then opening the file will launch Word as an OLE document within the Workbench editor area.
      Notice how OLE documents also add such features as menus and toolbar buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following illustrates Microsoft Word embedded as an OLE document:</p>
