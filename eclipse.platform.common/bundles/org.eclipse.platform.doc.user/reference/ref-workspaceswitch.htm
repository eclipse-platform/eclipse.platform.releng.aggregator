  <h1>Switching Workspaces</h1>
  <p>The current workspace for Eclipse can be switched by using the <strong>File-&gt;Switch Workspace</strong> command.
  If you have already switched your workspace previously the previous workspaces will be available for selection in the
  Switch Workspace menu.</p>
  <p>The Switch Workspace --&gt; Other.. menu item will open the switch workspace dialog. The dialog will allow you to
  browse for or manually enter a new workspace location. The combo will also allow you to select your previously
  selected workspaces.</p>

  <h2>Settings Transfers</h2>
  <p>When you switch your workspace you can select settings than will be transferred to the new workspace. These
  settings are supplied by the org.eclipse.ui.preferenceTransfer extension.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Workspace Layout: Opened views, their size, and selected perspectives.</li>
    <li>Working Sets: The user defined working sets.</li>
  </ul>
