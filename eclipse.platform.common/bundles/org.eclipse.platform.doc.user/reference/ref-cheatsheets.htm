  <h1>Working With Cheat Sheets</h1>
  <p class="Para">Eclipse provides cheat sheets to guide you through some of its application development processes.
  Each cheat sheet is designed to help you complete some task, and it lists the sequence of steps required to help you
  achieve that goal. As you progress from one step to the next, the cheat sheet will automatically launch the required
  tools for you. If there is a manual step in the process, the step will tell you to perform the task and click a
  button in the cheat sheet to move on to the next step. Also, relevant help information to guide you through a task is
  retrieved in a single click so that lengthy documentation searches will no longer be required.</p>
  <p class="Para">A <a href="ref-composite-cheatsheets.htm">composite cheat sheet</a> is another kind of cheat sheet
  that provides guidance for larger tasks or a group of related tasks.</p>
  <h3>Launching a Cheat Sheet</h3>
  <p>To launch a cheat sheet from the Workbench</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select <a class="command-link" href=
    'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.openCheatSheet")'><img src=
    "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>Help &gt; Cheat Sheets</strong></a>
    from the menu bar. If this command is not in the menu, it can be added from <b>Window &gt; Customize Perspective
    &gt; Commands</b>, and check <b>Cheat Sheets</b>. <img src="../images/image92-opencheat.png" alt=
    "Accessing Cheat sheet via Help menu" border="0"></li>
    <li>The available cheat sheets are listed, select one and click <strong>OK</strong>. Alternatively if you know the
    location of a cheat sheet content file on your file system or on the web you can enter its path.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The cheat sheet opens as a view. At any time, only one cheat sheet is open and active. When you launch a cheat
  sheet, any opened cheat sheet is closed before the new one is opened. The completion status of closed cheat sheet is
  saved.</p>
  <p>The cheat sheet has a toolbar at the top right edge. These icons appear in the toolbar:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="../images/collapse_expand_all.svg" alt="Collapse button" border="0">Collapses all the expanded steps
    except the current step or expands steps to the last expanded state. Click to toggle between these two states.</li>
    <li><img src="../images/view_menu.svg" alt="Select button" border="0">Allows you to select and open another cheat
    sheet. The completion status of the active cheat sheet is saved. Then, the active cheat sheet is closed and the
    selected cheat sheet is opened.</li>
    <li><img src="../images/thin_min_view.svg" alt="Hide button" border="0">Hides the cheat sheet.</li>
    <li><img src="../images/maximize.svg" alt="Save button" border="0">Maximizes the cheat sheet.<br></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that some cheat sheets can also be launched from the welcome page by first selecting <b>Tutorials</b> and
  then selecting one of the tutorials.<br></p>
  <h3>Starting the Cheat Sheet</h3>
  <p>Each cheat sheet has a list of steps and it always begins with an Introduction step. When you launch a fresh cheat
  sheet, the Introduction step is expanded so that you can read a brief description of the cheat sheet. To start
  working with the cheat sheet, click <strong>Click to Begin</strong> <strong><img src="../images/start_ccs_task.svg"
  alt="Click to Begin button" border="0"></strong> in that step. The next step is expanded and highlighted. You should
  also see one or more actions buttons, such as <strong>Click to Perform</strong> <strong><img src=
  "../images/start_task.svg" alt="Click to Perform button" border="0"></strong> in the highlighted step. You can now
  begin working through the tasks using the cheat sheet. At any time, the only highlighted step in the cheat sheet is
  the current step.</p>
  <h3>Restarting the Cheat Sheet</h3>
  <p>Any time after starting a cheat sheet, you can restart from the first step by clicking <strong>Click to
  Restart</strong> <strong><img src="../images/return_to_start.svg" alt="Click to Restart button" border="0"></strong>
  in the Introduction step. If you have already created some artifacts, you will have to manually clean up the
  workspace before restarting the cheat sheet.</p>
  <h3>Progressing Through the Steps</h3>
  <p>In the current step, when you click <strong>Click to Perform <img src="../images/start_task.svg" alt=
  "Click to Perform button" border="0"></strong>, a tool (which can be a wizard), will be launched and you will be
  required to work with that tool. When you finish working with that tool, the next step is automatically highlighted
  and it becomes the current step. When the current step is a manual task, you will need to perform the work and click
  <strong>Click to Complete</strong> <strong><img src="../images/complete_task.svg" alt="Click to Complete button"
  border="0"></strong> to move to the next step. A check mark <strong><img src="../images/complete_status.svg" alt=
  "Check mark icon" border="0"></strong> appears in the left margin of each completed step.</p>
  <h3>Getting Help Information for Tasks</h3>
  <p>To get step-by-step instructions for that step, click the help link <strong><img src="../images/linkto_help.svg"
  alt="Help Link Icon" border="0"></strong> in the step before you click <strong>Click to Perform</strong>
  <strong><img src="../images/start_task.svg" alt="Click to Perform button" border="0"></strong>, and the step-by-step
  instructions on how to work with that tool will be displayed in the Help window.</p>
  <p>Additional help for entry fields in the tool or wizard may be available by focusing on the field (use the
  <strong>Tab</strong> key to position to that entry) and pressing <strong>F1</strong>.</p>
  <h3>Skipping a Step</h3>
  <p>If a current step has a <strong>Click to Skip</strong> option <strong><img src="../images/skip_status.svg" alt=
  "Click to Skip button" border="0"></strong>, then it is an optional step. You must click <strong>Click to
  Skip</strong> <strong><img src="../images/skip_status.svg" alt="Click to Skip button" border="0"></strong> to skip
  the current step, when you do, the step will have the skip mark <strong><img src="../images/skip_status.svg" alt=
  "Skip mark icon" border="0"></strong> in the left margin. If the task does not present <strong>Click to
  Skip</strong>, you must perform that step and you cannot skip it.</p>
  <h3>Redoing a Step</h3>
  <p>You can redo any step that you may have completed or skipped in the current cheat sheet. To redo the step, expand
  the step by clicking its expand icon and then clicking <strong>Click to Redo</strong>. After redoing a step, the
  cheat sheet will continue from the redo step.</p>
  <h3>Closing the Cheat Sheet</h3>
  <p>When you finish the last step in a cheat sheet, it automatically restarts. You can also close the active cheat
  sheet by clicking the close icon <strong><img src="../images/close_view.svg" alt="Close icon" border="0"></strong> in
  the cheat sheet's toolbar. The active cheat sheet saves its completion status when it is closed so that you can
  continue where you left off at a later time.</p>
