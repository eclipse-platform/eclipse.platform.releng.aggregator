  <h1 class="Head">Local History</h1>
  <p>Local history of a file is maintained when you create or modify a file. Each time you edit and save a file, a copy
  of it is saved. This allows you to compare your current file state to a previous state, or replace the file with a
  previous state. Each state in the local history is identified by the date and time the file was saved.</p>
  <p>Neither projects nor folders have local history.</p>
  <p>Local History is displayed in the History View. Here is a look at what the local history of a Workbench file might
  look like:</p>
  <p><img src="../images/Image273_local_hist.png" alt="Local history dialog" border="0"></p>

  bring up the History view and populate it with the revisions of the selected file. You can open different revisions
  from the table (by using <b>Open</b> from the context menu or by double clicking on a revision), compare them against
  the latest revision or against a previous revisions (by using <b>Compare With Revision</b> from the context menu),
  and replace the current revision with the contents of a previous revisions (by using <b>Get Contents</b> from the
  context menu).</p>
