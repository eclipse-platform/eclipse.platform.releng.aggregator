  alt="command link"> <strong>General &gt; Capabilities</strong></a> preference page allows you to enable or disable
  various product components such as Java development and plug-in development. By default, the page only shows general
  categories of behavior. If you would like configure fine-grained capabilities you should use the "Advanced"
  dialog.</p>
  <p class="Para"><strong>Note:</strong> Some capability selections have dependencies on other capabilities, disabling
  a required capability while leaving dependant capabilities enabled will only result in them becoming re-enabled. This
  is the case when deselecting Java development and Core Team Support.</p>
  <p>When attempting to enable an action after its capability has been disabled or has yet to be enabled in the
  preferences page, a <strong>Confirm Enablement</strong> prompt will appear verifying that you do indeed want to
  enable the required capability. Click <strong>Details</strong> to display a description of the capability.</p>
  <p class="Para"><strong>Note:</strong> This dialog only appears if the "Prompt when enabling capabilities" preference
  has not been disabled.</p>
