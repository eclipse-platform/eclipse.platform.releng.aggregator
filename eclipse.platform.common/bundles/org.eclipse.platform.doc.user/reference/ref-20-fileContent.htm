  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>Team &gt; File
  Content</strong></a> preference page, you can associate file names or extensions with the type of data the file
  contains. The two choices for file content type are ASCII and Binary. Repository providers can then use
  this information to provide content type appropriate behavior.</p>
  <p class="Intro">Entries are added to the File Content page in two ways. The first is through contributions from
  workbench plug-ins. Tools integrated into the workbench provide the workbench with the file content types for file
  extensions specific to the tool. The workbench itself also defines the file content type for file extensions that are
  common and appear frequently in the workbench (e.g. html,.png, etc.).</p>
  <p class="Intro">The second method is for users to add file content types explicitly on the File Content preference
  page. To do so, you can simply click on the <strong>Add Extension</strong> button and enter an extension or click on
  the <strong>Add Name</strong> button and add a name.. Following this, you can toggle the type associated with the
  name or extension by selecting the entry for the extension in the table and clicking <strong>Change</strong>. Entries
  can be removed from the list by selecting them and clicking <strong>Remove</strong>. Only those entries that were
  manually added can be removed. Entries contributed through the plug-in manifest can only be changed.</p>
