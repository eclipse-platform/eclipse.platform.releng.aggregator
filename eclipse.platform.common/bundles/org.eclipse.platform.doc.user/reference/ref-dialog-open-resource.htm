  <h1>Open Resource</h1>
  <p>This dialog allows you to browse the workbench for a file to open in an editor</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Select an item to open</strong>: In this field, type a few characters of the name of the file you
      want to select. By default, the input pattern is searched <em>anywhere</em> in the file name and
      with the exception of "Camel case" pattern (see below), the search is <em>case-insensitive</em>.
      <p>The following pattern kinds are supported:</p><br>
      <strong>Wildcards</strong>:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>"*" for any string and "?" for any character</li>
        <li>leading "&gt;" to force matching from the start, e.g. "&gt;rea" to match
          <code>README.txt</code>, but not <code>creators.txt</code></li>
        <li>terminating "&lt;" or " " (space) to force matching at the end, e.g. "M*file&lt;" to match
          <code>Makefile</code> and <code>xMockFile</code>, but not <code>xMockFiles</code></li>
      </ul><strong>Camel case</strong>:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>"CS" for file names containing "C" and "S" as upper-case letters in camel-case notation, e.g.
        <code>CreateStuff.java</code></li>
        <li>"CreSNo" for file names containing "Cre", "S", and "No" as parts in camel-case notation, e.g.
        <code>CreateStuffNow.jsp</code></li>
        <li>leading "&gt;" to force matching from the start, e.g. "&gt;CreS" to match
          <code>CreateStuff.java</code>, but not <code>DoCreateStuff.java</code></li>
        <li>terminating "&lt;" or " " (space) to fix the number of camel-case parts, e.g. CreS&lt;" to match
          <code>CreateStuff.java</code>, but not <code>CreateStuffNow.jsp</code> nor <code>Createstuff.txt</code></li>
      </ul><strong>Folder prefixes</strong>:<br>
      <p>Both pattern kinds also support <strong>folder prefixes</strong>. If the pattern contains a /, the part before
      the last / is used to match a path in the workspace, e.g. "org.eclipse.ui/plugin.xml".<br>
      Or a bit more complex: "*/ui&lt;/pack*.html" matches e.g. files called "package.html" in a folder named "ui" (but
      not in folders like "uitools" or "*/ui/internal").</p><br>
      <strong>Relative paths</strong>:<br>
      <p>For example, "./Mak" matches all files which have "Mak" in their name
        and are in the folder of the active editor or selection,
      while "../Mak" matches such files in the parent folder.</p><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Matching items</strong>: This list displays matches for the pattern you type in the <strong>Select an
      item to open</strong> field.
      <ul>
        <li>Recently opened files show up in a history section at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>If the pattern matches many files with the same name, the files that are closer to the currently edited or
        selected resource are shown on top of the matching items list.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <b>Open</b> button opens the file with the default editor for the chosen file. A different editor can be
  selected in the context menu on a file or in the <b>Open With</b> drop-down button.</p>
  <p>The <b>Show In</b> drop-down button can be used to show the chosen file in a view.</p>
  <p>The behavior of the <strong>Open Resource</strong> dialog can be further customized using the dialog menu:</p>
