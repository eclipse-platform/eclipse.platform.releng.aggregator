  <h1 class="Head">View Toolbars</h1>
  <p class="Para">View toolbars contain actions that apply only to the particular view in which they appear. The view
  toolbar also contains a context menu that contains other actions for that view. This menu is opened by clicking on
  the downwards pointing triangle. If there is enough space, view toolbars are in the view tab area. Otherwise they
  appear in the view.</p>
  <p class="Para">Here is an example of the view toolbar for the Properties view:</p>
