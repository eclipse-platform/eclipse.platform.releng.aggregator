  <h2>Windows Defender Exclusion Check</h2>
  <p>On Microsoft Windows 10 or later the <i>Microsoft Defender</i> can significantly slow down the startup and 
     overall performance of Eclipse-based applications.
     These applications can now detect if <i>Microsoft Defender</i> is active, inform you about that and, if wanted, 
     can exclude itself from future <i>Microsoft Defender</i> scans.
  </p>
  <p>If <i>Microsoft Defender</i> is active, on first startup of a new installation, a dialog is shown.
     Depending on your choice the exclusion is performed for the running installation or the 
     <i>Microsoft Defender</i> configuration is left untouched. 
     In both cases the choice is persisted and it is not asked again for this installation. 
     If you choose to cancel the dialog (by clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;Escape&quot;) the dialog is shown 
     again on the next startup.
  </p>
  <p>In the &quot;Windows Defender Exclusion Check&quot; section of this preference page you get more detailed 
     information about the <i>Microsoft Defender</i> handling, you can choose to disable the startup check for 
     all installations, run the exclusion check or to see the Powershell script used to exclude the current 
     installation.
     Clicking &quot;Run exclusion check&quot; opens the startup dialog regardless of all persisted preferences. 
     Clicking the &quot;Show Powershell script&quot; button, unfolds the code of that script for review.
  </p>
  <h3>Note</h3>
  <p>Be aware that in general adding exclusion could affect your computer's security level and therefore needs 
      administrator privileges. 
     The exclusion from <i>Microsoft Defender</i> scaning is done on process level. This means that 
  <i>Microsoft Defender</i> won't real-time scan any file opened by the excluded process. 
     This way the performance improvement applies to all files touched by the process and not only the jars 
     forming the application. At the same time it allows scheduled or on-demand scans to still check all files.
   </p>
   <p>
     In general if you do not trust the installed application, plug-ins or content in the workspace, it is not 
     recommended to apply any exclusion.
  </p>
  <h2>Plug-Ins Activated on Startup</h2>
  <p>The &quot;plug-ins activated on startup&quot; section allows the selection of plug-ins to be automatically 
     activated during workbench startup. Normally plug-ins are not activated until they are needed. However 
     some plug-ins may specify that they wish to be activated during startup. This list allows the selection 
     of which of these plug-ins will actually be activated during startup.</p>
