  alt="command link"> <strong>General &gt; Tracing</strong></a> preference page allows you to modify the tracing
  options of plug-ins dynamically.</p>
  <p>Plug-ins may provide OSGi tracing options that write out additional logging information when the appropriate flag
  is set. You can set tracing options using a <em>.options</em> file. However, any changes to the flags require a
  restart.</p>
  <p>If a plug-in supports changing tracing options dynamically (without restarting) they will be listed on this
  preference page. The changes will be made once <strong>OK</strong> is pressed.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Tracing output</strong> settings allow more control over where tracing messages are put. A different
  output file can be chosen. A new file will be created each time the plug-in is started. If the maximum number of
  trace files stored has been reached, the oldest file will be deleted. Setting a maximum trace file size prevents
  excessively large log files from being created.</p>
  <p>Not all plug-ins will write their trace messages to the output file. Some plug-ins instead write to console output
  or perform other tasks.</p>
