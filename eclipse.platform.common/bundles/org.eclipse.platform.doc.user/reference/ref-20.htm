  Resources</strong></a> preference page, you can specify file name patterns to exclude from the version control
  management system. There is a list of file patterns against which resources will be matched before they are
  considered as version control candidates. These patterns may contain the wildcard characters "*" and "?". This
  pattern "*" represents any sequence of zero or more characters. This pattern "?" represents any one character. For
  example, you can specify a pattern of "*~", which would match any temporary files that end with "~". Any file or
  directory that matches any one of the patterns will be ignored during update or commit operations.</p>
  <p class="Para">To add a file type to the ignore list, simply click <strong>Add Pattern</strong>. In the dialog,
  enter a file type (e.g. *.class). To remove a file type from the ignore list, simply select the file type in the
  ignore list and click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
  <p class="Para">You can temporarily disable ignoring the file pattern by deselecting it from the list. You do not
  have to remove the specified file pattern from the list to temporarily disable it.</p>
