  associate file extension types and file sizes to an editor. Upon opening a file with the given extension, if the file
  is above the specified size, the associated editor will be used to open the file. When multiple pairs of editor and
  file size are specified for the extension of the file, the pair with the largest matching file size applies.</p>
