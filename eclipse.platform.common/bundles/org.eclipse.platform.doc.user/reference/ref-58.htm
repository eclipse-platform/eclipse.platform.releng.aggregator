  <h1>Navigate Menu</h1>
  <p class="Intro">This menu allows you to locate and navigate through resources and other artifacts displayed in the
  Workbench.</p>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Go Into</h2>
    <p class="Para">This command refocuses the active view so that the current selection is at the root. This allows
    web browser style navigation within hierarchies of artifacts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2 class="Head">Go To</h2>
    <ul class="UnorderedList">
      <li class="Item"><b>Back</b>: This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately prior to the
      current display. For example, if you Go Into a resource, then the Back command in the resulting display returns
      the view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the Go Into command. This command is similar to the Back
      button in an HTML browser.</li>
      <li class="Item"><b>Forward</b>: This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately after the
      current display. For example, if you've just selected the Back command, then selecting the Forward command in the
      resulting display returns the view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the Back command. This command
      is similar to the Forward button in an HTML browser.</li>
      <li class="Item"><b>Up one level</b>: This command displays the hierarchy of the parent of the current
      highest-level resource.</li>
      <li class="Item"><b>Resource</b>: This command allows you to navigate quickly to a resource. For more information
      see the links to related tasks below.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Open Hyperlink</h2>
    <p>This command opens one or more hyperlinks at the current caret location. If there's only one link available it
    directly opens the hyperlink, else brings up the chooser showing all the available hyperlinks at that location.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Open Resource</h2>
    <p>This command displays a dialog that lets you select any resource in the workspace to open it in an editor. For
    more information see the links to related tasks below.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Show In</h2>
    <p>This sub-menu is used to find and select the currently selected resource in another view. If an editor is
    active, these commands are used to select the resource currently being edited in another view.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Next</h2>
    <p class="Para">This command navigates to the next item in a list or table in the active view. For example, when
    the search results view is active, this navigates to the next search result.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h2>Previous</h2>
    <p class="Para">This command navigates to the previous item in a list or table in the active view. For example,
    when the search results view is active, this navigates to the previous search result.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Topic">
