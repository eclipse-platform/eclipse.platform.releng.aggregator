  <h1>Project Explorer View</h1>
  <p class="Intro">This view provides a hierarchical view of the artifacts in the Workbench, which is customized by the
  specific configuration of your Workbench.</p>
  <p>From here, you can open files for editing or select resources for operations such as exporting.</p>
  <p class="Para">A typical Project Explorer with only the Java Development Tools (JDT) installed looks similar to the
  Package Explorer:</p>
  <p>Right-click on any resource in the Project Explorer view to open a pop-up menu that allows you to perform
  operations such as copying, moving, creating new resources, comparing resources with each other, or performing team
  operations. To see a description of what each menu item does, move selection highlight to that menu item and press
  the context-sensitive help key (e.g., F1 on Microsoft Windows).</p>
  <p class="Head">By default, the Project Explorer view is included in the Resources perspective. To add the Project
  Explorer view to the current perspective, click <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.views.showView(org.eclipse.ui.views.showView.viewId=org.eclipse.ui.navigator.ProjectExplorer)")'>

  &gt; General &gt; Project Explorer</b></a>.</p>
  <h2>Toolbar</h2>
  <div class="Topic"></div>
  <h3>Collapse All</h3>
  <p>This command collapses the tree expansion state of all resources in the view.</p>
  <h3>Link With Editor</h3>
  <p>This command toggles whether the Project Explorer selection is linked to the active editor. When this option is
  selected, changing the active editor will automatically update the Project Explorer selection to the resource being
  edited.</p>
  <h3>Select and Deselect Content to Filter to the Content in the Tree</h3>
  <p>This command opens a dialog allowing to configure some filters to enable.</p>
  <h2>View Menus</h2>
  <p>Click the ⋮ vertical ellipsis to open a menu of items specific to the Project Explorer. Some extra menu entries
  can be added by extension and may not be documented here.</p>
  <h3>Project Presentation</h3>
  <p>Select whether the physically nested projects should be shown as root elements (Flat), or should be shown under
  their parent project in place of their corresponding folder (Hierarchical).</p>
  <h3>Top-Level Elements</h3>
  <p>Select whether the top level-elements should be the selected working sets with projects as children, or the
  visible projects.</p>
  <h3>Select Working Set</h3>
  <p>Opens the <b>Select Working Set</b> dialog to allow selecting a working set for the Project Explorer.</p>
  <h3>Deselect Working Set</h3>
  <p>Deselects the current working set.</p>
  <h3>Edit Active Working Set</h3>
  <p>Opens the <b>Edit Working Set</b> dialog to allow changing the current working set.</p>
  <p><br>
  In addition to these menu items, the Project Explorer menu shows a list of recently used working sets that have been
  selected in the view.</p>
  <div class="Topic">
    <h3>Filters and Customization</h3>
    <p class="Para">This command allows you to change the view for your specific needs. You may select pre-defined
    filters to apply to the view so that you can show or hide various artifacts as needed. The default filters
    available with the Java development tools (JDT) is shown below:</p>
    <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image276_available_filters.png" alt=
    "Available Customizations &gt; Filters dialog" style="border:0"></p>
    <p class="Para">You can also define your own filters based on the name of a resource. Full name or regular
    expressions are allowed.</p>
    <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image276_user_filters.png" alt=
    "Available Customizations &gt; User filters dialog" style="border:0"></p>
    <p class="Para">You may also choose the types of content for the view to show as well. The default content
    extensions available with the Java development tools (JDT) is shown below, but your specific extensions will be
    determined by your workbench configuration:</p>
    <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image276_available_content.png" alt=
    "Available Customizations &gt; Content dialog" style="border:0"></p>
  </div>
