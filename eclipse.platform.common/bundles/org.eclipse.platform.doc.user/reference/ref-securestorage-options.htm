  <h1 class="Head">Secure Storage Runtime Options</h1>
  <h4>Changing Location of Secure Storage</h4>
  <p>By default, secure storage is located in your home directory. On Windows that typically resolves to
  <i>"C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user_name&gt;\.eclipse\org.eclipse.equinox.security"</i>. This location is selected
  to allow multiple Eclipse-based applications to share the same secure storage.</p>
  <p>If you would like to modify the location of the default secure storage, you can use the "-eclipse.keyring
  &lt;file_path&gt;" runtime option. The &lt;file_path&gt; is a path to the file which is used to persist the secure
  storage data.</p>
  <p>The current location of the default secure storage can be found on the <a class="command-link" href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui.storage)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link"> <strong>General &gt; Security &gt;
  Secure Storage</strong></a> preferences page.</p>
  <h4>Password File</h4>
  <p>The password provider mechanism can be bypassed if you specify the "-eclipse.password &lt;file path&gt;" runtime
  option. In this case the contents of the file you specified as the argument will be used as a master password. While
  this option is valuable in some circumstances (such as headless applications), the protection of the password file
  becomes a consideration. The password file can be protected by the operating system access rights and/or by placing
  it on a removable storage, such as a USB key.</p>
