  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link" /> <b>Preferences</b></a> dialog pages
  to set how you want Eclipse to operate. The menu path is "Window &gt; Preferences" on Windows and Linux - on macOS
  the Preferences can be found in the "App" menu.</p>
  <p>You can browse the Preferences dialog pages by looking through all the titles in the left pane or search a smaller
  set of titles by using the filter field at the top of the left pane. The results returned by the filter will match
  both Preference page titles and keywords such as "appearance" and "java". However, to find specific functions you may
  have to search the online help instead.</p>
  <p>The arrow controls in the upper-right of the right pane <img src="../images/backward_nav.svg" alt=
  "Navigate backwards image" /> <img src="../images/forward_nav.svg" alt="Navigate forwards image" /> enable you to
  navigate through previously viewed pages. To return to a page after viewing several pages, click the drop-down arrow
  to display a list of your recently viewed preference pages.</p>
  <p>Preference pages contributed by plug-ins are included in this dialog.</p>
