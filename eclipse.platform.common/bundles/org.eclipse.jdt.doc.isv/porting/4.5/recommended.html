<h2>1. <a name="formatterPlugin">Formatter Extension Point</a></h2>
<p>

A new extension point with id <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCore.JAVA_FORMATTER_EXTENSION_POINT_ID</code> has been added which can be used
to provide a custom formatter. By default, the formatter is <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCore.DEFAULT_JAVA_FORMATTER</code>.

<h2>2. <a name="importrewrite">Import Rewrite Cleanup</a></h2>
<p>
Import rewrite has been cleaned up to provide consistent behavior and has the following features: </p>
<ul>
	<li>All unmatched imports are placed together in a single match-all group.</li>
	<li>The behavior of removing comments has been made consistent between the two rewrite modes - incremental mode and "Organize Imports" mode -
	if there is a corresponding on-demand import for a removed single import or vice-versa, comments are moved there;
	otherwise they are removed entirely.</li>
	<li>Comments (trailing comments included) relocated from single import(s) to an on-demand import or vice-versa are now always placed on line(s) preceding the destination import. </li>
	<li>Comments after a package declaration are no longer treated as file header comments.</li>
	<li>Blank lines around and between comments are now preserved, and consequently preserving existing
	formatting and also preventing comments from becoming associated with different imports.</li>
</ul>
