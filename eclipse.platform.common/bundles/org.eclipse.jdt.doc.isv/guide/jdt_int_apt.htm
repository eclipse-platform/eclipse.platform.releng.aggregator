<h2>JDT Annotation Processing</h2>
<p> JDT Annotation Processing (APT) (<b>org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core</b>) is the plug-in that supports compile-time 
    processing of Java annotations.  You should only need to list this plug-in as a dependency if your plug-in is an
    annotation processor.</p>
<p> For an introduction to working with APT, see 
	<a href="jdt_apt_getting_started.htm">Getting Started with APT</a>.  For information on how to access APT
	during command-line builds, see <a href="jdt_apt_building_with_apt.htm">Headless Building With APT</a>.</p>
