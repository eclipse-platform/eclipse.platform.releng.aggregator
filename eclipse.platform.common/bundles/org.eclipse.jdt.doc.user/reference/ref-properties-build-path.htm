    <h1>Java Build Path</h1>

    <p>The options in this page indicate the build path settings for a Java project. You can reach this page through the project properties (Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java Build Path) from the context menu on a created project or the <a href="ref-menu-file.htm">File
      menu</a> of the workbench.</p>

    <p>The build class path is a list of paths visible to the compiler when building the project.</p>

    <p>For projects targeting Java 9 or greater, entries on the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> and <a href="#libraries">Libraries</a> tabs
     can be placed either on the traditional Classpath or on the Modulepath.
     Entries on the Modulepath are interpreted as <strong>modules</strong> according to the 
     <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec">Java Platform Module System</a>.
     For these, further details can be edited via <a href="propertypages/ref-properties-buildpath-modularity.htm">Modularity Details</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>This property page consists of the following tabs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#source">Source tab</a></li>
    <li><a href="#projects">Projects tab</a></li>
    <li><a href="#libraries">Libraries tab</a></li>
    <li><a href="#order-and-export">Order and Export tab</a></li>
    <li><a href="#module-dependencies">Module Dependencies tab</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="source">Source Tab</h2>

    <p>Source folders are top-level folders in the project hierarchy. They are the root of packages containing .java files. 
    The compiler will translate the contained files to .class files that will be written to the output folder.</p>
<p>Source folders allow to structure the project, for example to separate 
test from the application in two source folders. Within a source folder, a more detailed structuring can be achieved by using packages.</p> 
<p>Each source folder can define an exclusion filter to specify which 
resources inside the folder should not be visible to the compiler.</p>
<p>Resources existing in source folders are copied to the output folder unless the setting in the <a href="preferences/java/compiler/ref-preferences-building.htm">Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Building</a> preference
    page specifies that the resource is filtered. The output folder is defined per project except if a source folder specifies its own output folder.</p>

			that are not configured to be visible for test code only. When compiling test code, all code on build path 
			is visible. When compiling test code with Java 9, the unnamed module is assumed to be readable 
			by the current module, so test dependencies that should not be mentioned in the <code>module-info.java</code> are accessible if they are put 
			on the classpath.</td>

    <p>At the bottom of this page, the <b>Default output folder</b> field allows you to enter a path to a folder path where the compilation output for this
    project will reside. The default output is used for source folders that do not specify an own output folder. Use <b>Browse</b> to select an existing location from the current project.</p>
    
    <h2 id="projects">Projects Tab</h2>

    <p>In the <b>Required projects on the build path</b> list, you can add project dependencies by selecting other workbench
    projects to add to the build path for this new project.</p>

    <p>Adding a required project indirectly adds all its classpath entries marked as 'exported'. Setting a classpath entry as exported is done in the Order and Export tab.</p>

    <p>The projects selected here are automatically added to the referenced projects list. The referenced project list is used to determine the build order. A project is always
    build after all its referenced projects are built.</p>

    <p>On this page, you can add libraries to the build path.</p>
    <p>By default, the library list contains an entry representing the Java runtime library.  This entry points to the JRE
    selected as the default JRE. The default JRE is configured in the <a href="preferences/java/debug/ref-installed_jres.htm">Java &gt; Debug &gt; Installed JREs</a> preferences page.</p>

<h2 id="order-and-export">Order and Export Tab</h2>

    <p>In the <b>Build class path order</b> list, you can click the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons to move the selected path entry up or down in the build path order for this new project.</p>

    <p>Checked list entries are marked as exported. Exported entries are visible to projects that require the project. Use the <b>Select
    All</b> and <b>Deselect All</b> to change the checked state of all entries. Source folders are always exported,
    and can not be deselected.</p>
    
<h2 id="module-dependencies">Module Dependencies Tab</h2>
	<p>For projects targeting Java 9 or greater this page visualizes module-related aspects of all dependencies of the current project.
	At the left the <b>All Modules</b> list shows all modules that are considered when building the current projects.
	At the right <b>Details</b> of a selected module are shown, along with buttons to modify these details.</p>
	
	<p>The <b>All Modules</b> list uses the following icon decorations to distinguish different kinds of modules:</p>
	<table class="border">
		<caption>Module decorations</caption>
	<tbody>
	<tr><th>Decorated Icon</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td><img src="../images/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/combined/focus_module.svg" alt="focus module" style="width:30px"></td>

		<td>An <b>automatic</b> module, i.e., a module that is not declared using <code>module-info.java</code>,

	</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Operations offered for the All Modules list:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>You may remove one or more System modules by selecting the respective modules and clicking the <b>Remove</b>
		button at the right. Note, that other modules need to be removed from the build path on the respective
		Projects or Libraries tab.</li>
	<li>If the current project lacks file <code>module-info.java</code>, i.e., types in the project are associated
		with the "unnamed module", then by default only a subset of System modules is considered. In this case
		you can pull in more System modules by clicking the <b>Add System Module...</b> button.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Modules that have just been added to the Modulepath on the corresponding tab of this page,
		will not be visible in this list immediately.
		In this case you need to click <b>Apply</b> to update the All Modules list.</em></p>
	
	<p>The <b>Details</b> tree has two root nodes:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>under the top node <b>Declared details of <i>modulename</i></b>
	you can find those details that are declared in the select module's description, namely representations
	of all <b>requires</b>, <b>exports</b> and <b>opens</b> declarations.</li>
	<li>under <b>Configured details</b> additional properties of the selected module can be configured.</li>

	<p>Operations offered for the Details tree, provided that a module has been selected in the All Modules list:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>By clicking <b>Read Module...</b> you can create a new dependency from the select module to one or more other modules.</li>
	<li>By clicking <b>Expose Package...</b> you can define that the selected module <b>exports</b> or 
		<b>opens</b> one of its packages. The dialog that opens when you click this button supports code completion
		for selecting a package and also has a field where a list of target modules can be specified.</li>
	<li>By double clicking an existing <b>exports</b> or <b>opens</b> node you can edit its details.
		The same can also be done by clicking the <b>Edit...</b> button.</li>
	<li>By clicking <b>Patch with...</b> you can select a project or source folder for patching the selected module.</li>
	<li>Any node under the <b>Configured details</b> node can be removed by clicking <b>Remove</b></li>
	<li>Everything that has been configured in this tab can be translated into a set of command line options
		as specified by the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).
		To do so click the <b>Show JPMS Options...</b> button.<br> 
		These options could be used for invoking a compiler from the command line,
		or as runtime options when launching the program, to ensure that the JVM
		will see the same module graph that has been configured here.</li>
