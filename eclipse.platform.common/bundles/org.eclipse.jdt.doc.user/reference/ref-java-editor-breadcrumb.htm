    </p>
    <p>

      To enable the breadcrumb invoke <strong>Toggle Java Editor
      Breadcrumb</strong> in the toolbar or press <strong>Alt+Shift+B</strong>
      in the Java editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breadcrumb allows to invoke actions on any element shown in the
      breadcrumb. Actions can be invoked through a context menu or through key
      bindings. To select an element in the breadcrumb either click on it or
      press <strong>Alt+Shift+B</strong> in the Java editor and then use the
      <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> arrow keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the breadcrumb it is also possible to navigate to other elements in
      the workspace: Click on one of the arrows or any element to open a drop
      down window. The drop down shows all siblings of the element for which
      the drop down was opened. To open an element click on it. To open the
      drop down with the keyboard, select an element and press the
      <strong>down</strong> arrow key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enablement of the breadcrumb is remembered for each perspective. The
      breadcrumb can for example be enabled in the debug perspective and be
      disabled in the Java perspective.
