      Configure Working Sets Dialog
    </h1>
    <p>
     The Configure Working Sets dialog provides means to configure the contents and order of the working sets along with creating new ones 
     and removing existing working sets.
    </p>
	<p>
     Use <strong>Configure Working Sets...</strong> from the Package Explorer's view menu when it is showing working sets as top level elements. 
	</p>
    <p>
      The dialog presents a list of working sets, whose visibility in the Package Explorer can be configured by checking or unchecking it and the order can be configured
      either manually, by moving them up or down in the list, or by having them automatically sorted. Working sets can also be created or removed and their 
      contents can be configured. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After pressing <strong>OK</strong>, the checked working sets will be visible in the Package Explorer with their configured contents and order.
