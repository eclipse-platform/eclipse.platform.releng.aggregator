      Processor Option Input Dialog
    </title>

    <h1>
      Processor Option Input Dialog
    </h1>
    <p>The Processor Option input dialog is reached from the <a href="ref-apt-config.htm">Annotation Processing
    preferences pane</a>.  It allows processor options to be added or modified.</p>  

    <p>Options entered here will be presented to processors using the Java 5 Mirror APIs through the 
    AnnotationProcessorEnvironment interface, or to processors using the Java 6 annotation processing
    APIs through the ProcessingEnvironment interface.  For Java 5 processors, in order to be compatible
    with other implementations of this API, each option will be presented in two forms: as a key/value 
    pair, and as a combined key corresponding to the command-line form of the option, namely 
    &quot;-Akey=value&quot;. For instance, an option with key &quot;foo&quot; and value &quot;bar&quot; would be presented
    both that way and as key &quot;-Afoo=bar&quot;, value null. For Java 6 processors, the options are
    simply presented as a map of key/value pairs, without the -A and without the combined -Akey=value form.</p>

    <p>Option values representing paths may begin with a percent-delimited token such as <code>%FOO%/</code>. 
    If the token is the name of a <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/concepts/concept-classpath-variables.htm">
    classpath variable</a>, it will be replaced with the current value of the variable at processor execution time. 
    For example, if <code>FOO</code> is a classpath variable that points to <code>d:/foo</code>, then 
    <code>%FOO%/bar.txt</code> will resolve to <code>d:/foo/bar.txt</code> when the processor is called. If the 
    classpath variable does not exist, then the raw string (&quot;%FOO%&quot; in this example) will be added to the 
    environment options. However, the remainder of the string (&quot;bar.txt&quot; in this example) does not need to exist. 
    The special value <code>ROOT</code> expands to the absolute path of the workspace. For example, 
    <code>%ROOT%/foo/bar.xml</code> might expand to <code>d:/my_workspace/foo/bar.xml</code>. When using ROOT, the first 
    segment of the path must actually exist: in the example, the project <code>foo</code> must exist, but 
    <code>bar.xml</code> need not. Similarly, the special value <code>PROJECT.DIR</code> expands to the absolute path of 
    the current project.</p>

    <p>Certain options such as <code>-classpath</code> and <code>-sourcepath</code> are automatically provided to the 
    processors (for Java 5 processors; entering them in this dialog will have no effect, since the automatically provided 
    values will override any values set here), or provided to the processors as variables such as <code>%classpath%</code> 
    or <code>%sourcepath%</code> (for Java 6 processors). The automatic options are described 
    <a href="ref-apt-automaticProcessorOptions.htm">here</a>.</p>
