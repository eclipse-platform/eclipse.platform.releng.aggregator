<h1> Breakpoint Trigger Point</h1>
<p> Select the <strong>Trigger point </strong>option to define the selected breakpoint as a trigger point. </p>
<p>    
   All the other breakpoints that are initially suppressed by triggers will be hit only after any of the trigger points has been hit.
   All the triggers are disabled after a trigger point is hit and will be re-enabled after the run.
   Triggers will be rendered with an overlay of "T" and the breakpoints suppressed by the triggers will be
      rendered with an overlay of "T" with a cut.
