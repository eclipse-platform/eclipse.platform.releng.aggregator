<title>Breakpoint Hit Count</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Breakpoint Hit Count</h1>
<p> Select the <strong>Hit Count </strong>option to define a hit count for the selected breakpoint. </p>
<p>The <strong>Hit Count</strong> option is used to determine when your program should suspend on that breakpoint. </p>
<p>If a breakpoint has a hit count of <em>N</em>, execution will suspend when the breakpoint is encountered for the <em>N</em>th time. After being hit, the breakpoint is disabled until either it is re-enabled or its hit count is changed.<br>
  <br>
  This option can be changed in the <a href="../../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm#detail_pane"><strong>Breakpoints View</strong></a> detail pane, with the <a href="../../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-properties_contextaction.htm"><strong>Breakpoint Properties...</strong></a>, or by <a href="../../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-hitcount_contextaction.htm">right-clicking</a> a breakpoint.</p>
