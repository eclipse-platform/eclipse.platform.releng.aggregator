            Multiple versions of the same Java type can be available in a workspace, and each version can
            have breakpoints configured at different source locations. When debugging, JDT tries to
            determine the "right" set of breakpoints to install in the target VM. This analysis
            now uses Java project dependencies by default.
            <p>
            To always install all enabled breakpoints, you can disable this option.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note that not all projects use explicit Java project dependencies. E.g. OSGi bundles
            typically use a dynamically computed classpath where project dependencies are computed
            by PDE.

            This option controls if the debugger will use advanced source lookup implementation in addition to standard source lookup heuristics.

            Advanced source lookup is a reliable source lookup when multiple versions of the same Java type are present in the target application and when Java types loaded by the application are not fully known in advance. It also enables on-demand sources download by JDT-based tools like M2E (on demand sources download requires explicit support by the tool).

            Advanced source lookup is only available for applications running locally.
