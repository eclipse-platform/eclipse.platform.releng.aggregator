      This page allows you set filtering options that are used throughout the
      workbench to limit the exposure of certain kinds of launch
      configurations. These filtering setting affect the launch dialog, launch
      histories and the workbench.

            with it, but is not in the currently active working set, the
            configurations do not appear in the UI, much like P does not.

            from the UI, not just ones that fall under the other filtering
            categories.

            <p>
              As Eclipse matures and new features are added to the launching
              framework, there sometimes exists the need to make changes to
              launch configurations. Some of these changes are made
              automatically, but those that are not (nonreversible ones) are
              left up to the end-user.
            </p>
            <p>

              The migration section allows users to self-migrate any launch
              configurations that require it. Upon pressing the
              <strong>Migrate...</strong> button, if there are any
              configurations requiring migration, they are presented to the
              user, and the user can select the ones they want to migrate.
              Configuration migration is not un-doable.
