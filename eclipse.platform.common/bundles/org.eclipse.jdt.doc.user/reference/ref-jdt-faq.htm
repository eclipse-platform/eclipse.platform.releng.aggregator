      Frequently Asked Questions on Jdt
    </h1>
    <h3>
      Can I Use a Java Compiler Other Than the Built-in One (javac for Example)
      With the Workbench?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not with vanilla JDT. Some features of JDT such as Snippet evaluation do require usage
      of the built-in compiler and currently cannot work with another compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, note that JDT does provide some mechanisms to allow 3rd-party plugins to
      enable an external compiler instead of the built-in one for most features (completion,
      selection, search, incremental compilation, and so on) but actual usage of such third-party
      compilers is not something that JDT includes nor for which JDT is responsible.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Where Do Java Packages Come From?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A project contains only files and folders. The notion of a Java package
      is introduced by a Java project's class path (at the UI, the Package
      Explorer presents the packages as defined by the classpath).
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If the package structure is not what you expect,
      check out your class path. The Java search infrastructure only finds
      declarations for and references from Java elements on the class path.
    </p>
    <h3>

      When Do I Use an Internal Versus an External Jar Library File?
    </h3>
    <p>
      An internal resource resides in some project in the workbench and is
      therefore managed by the workbench; like other resources, these resources
      can be version managed by the workbench. An external resource is not part
      of the workbench and can be used only by reference. For example, a JRE is
      often external and very large, and there is no need to associate it with
      a VCM system.
    </p>
    <h3>
      When Should I Use Source Folders Within a Java Project?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Each Java project locates its Java source files via one or more source
      type entries on the project's class path. Use source folders to organize
      the packages of a large project into useful grouping, or to keep source
      code separate from other files in the same project. Also, use source
      folders if you have files (documentation for example) which need not be
      on the build path.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What Are Source Attachments, How Do I Define One?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Libraries are stored as JAR files containing binary class files (and
      perhaps other resources). These binary class files provide signature
      information for packages, classes, methods, and fields. This information
      is sufficient to compile or run against, but contains far less
      information that the original source code. In order to make it easier to
      browse and debug binary libraries, there is a mechanism for associating a
      corresponding source JAR (or ZIP) file with a binary JAR file.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why Are All My Resources Duplicated in the Output Folder (bin, for
      Example)?
    </h3>
    <p>

      If your Java project is using source folders, then in the course of
      compiling the source files in the project, the Java compiler copies
      non-Java resources to the output folder as well so that they will be
      available on the class path of the running program. To avoid certain
      resources to be copied to the output location you can set a resource
      filter in the Java compiler preferences: <strong>Window &gt; Preferences
      &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Building</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>
      How Do I Prevent Having My Documentation Files From Being Copied to the
      Project's Output Folder?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Use source folders and put any resources that you do not want to be
      copied to the output folder into a separate folder that is not included
      on the class path. You can also set a resource filter in the Java
      compiler preferences: <strong>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt;
      Compiler &gt; Building</strong> to for example *.doc.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How Do I Create a Default Package?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You don't have to. Files in the root folder of a source folder or project
      are considered to be in the default package. In effect, every source
      folder has the capability of having a fragment of the default package.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What Is Refactoring?
    </h3>
    <p>

      Refactoring means behavior-preserving program transformations. The JDT
      supports a number of transformations described in Martin Fowler's book
      <em>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</em>,
      Addison-Wisely 1999.
    </p>
    <h3>
      When Do I Use Open Declaration (f3)?
    </h3>
    <p>
      To find out the Java element that corresponds to the selected source
      range with the help of the compiler.
    </p>
    <h3>

      Is the Java Program Information (type Hierarchy, Declarations,
      References, for Example) Produced by the Java Builder? Is It Still
      Updated When Auto-build Is Off?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Java program information is independent from the Java builder. It is
      automatically updated when performing resource changes or Java
      operations. In particular, all the functionality offered by the Java
      tooling (for example, type hierarchies, code assisting, search) will
      continue to perform accurately when auto-build is off; for example, when
      doing heavy refactoring which require to turn off the builders, you can
      still use code assist, which will reflect the latest changes (not yet
      build). Other than the launching (that is, running and debugging) of
      programs, the only functionality which requires the Java builder is the
      evaluation of code snippets.
    </p>
    <h3>
      After Reopening a Workbench, the First Build That Happens After Editing a
      Java Source File Seems to Take a Long Time. Why Is That?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Java incremental project builder saves its internal state to a file
      when the workbench is closed. On the first build after the project is
      reopened, the Java incremental project builder will restore its internal
      state. When this file is large, the user experiences an unusually long
      build delay.
    </p>

    <h3>
      I Can't See a Type Hierarchy for My Class. What Can I Do?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Check that you have your build class path set up properly. Setting up the
      proper build class path is an important task when doing Java development.
      Without the correct build path, you will not be able to compile your
      code. In addition, you will not be able to search or look at the type
      hierarchies for Java elements.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How Do I Turn off "auto Compile" and Do It Manually When I Want?
    </h3>
    <p>

      Clear the <strong>Build automatically</strong> checkbox on the <a class=
      "command-link" href=
      'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Workspace)")'>
      <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt=
      "Opens the Workspace preference page" /> <strong>General &gt;
      Workspace</strong></a> preference page. When you want to build, press
      <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd>, or select <strong>Project &gt; Build All</strong> from
      the menu bar.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Hint</b>: when you turn "auto compile" off and build manually, you may
      also want to select the <strong>Save automatically before build</strong>
      checkbox on the <a class="command-link" href=
      'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Workspace)")'>
      <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt=
      "Opens the Workspace preference page" /> <strong>General &gt;
      Workspace</strong></a> preference page.
    </p>

    <h3>
      When I Select a Method or a Field in the Outline View, Only the Source
      for That Element Is Shown in the Editor. What Do I Do to See the Source
      of the Whole File?
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is a toolbar button <b>Show Source of Selected Element Only</b> -
      all you have to do is un-press it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Can I Nest Source Folders?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Yes, you can use exclusion filters to create nested source folders.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Can I Have Separate Output Folders for Each Source Folder?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, select the <b>Allow output folders for source folders</b> checkbox
      in the <b>Java Build Path &gt; Source</b> property page of your Java
      project.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Can I Have an Output or Source Folder That Is Located Outside of the
      Workspace?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you can create a linked folder that points to the desired location
      and use that folder as the source or output folder in your Java project.
    </p>
