      Annotation Processing Preferences

    <h1>
      Annotation Processing
    </h1>
    <p>Annotation processors are utility programs that can generate additional Java code or other files, 
    and produce problem markers,
    based on Java 5 (JSR-175) annotations. Processors can be based on either the 
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/apt/mirror/overview-summary.html">Java 5 Mirror APIs</a> or the
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/package-summary.html">Java 6 
    annotation processing APIs</a>. The Annotation Processing preference pane permits configuration 
    of preferences that apply to all processors in a project or workspace.  The <a href="ref-apt-factoryPath.htm">
    Factory Path preference pane</a> specifies which processors are enabled and permits configuration of 
    individual processors.</p>
    <h2>
        Enable Annotation Processing
    </h2>
    <p>Annotation processing is turned off by default, and must be turned on by checking this checkbox
    for each project that needs it.  It is only necessary to enable annotation processing in a project
    in order to have annotation processors operate on that project's code.  The mere presence of 
    annotations in code does not mean that annotation processing is required; for example, the 
    <code>@Deprecated</code> and <code>@Override</code> annotations do not typically require processing.</p> 
    <h2>
    	Enable Processing in Editor
    </h2>
    <p>When this option is enabled, processors will run whenever changes are made in the Java editor,
    as well as whenever the project is built. Enabling processors to run in the editor allows them to
    generate contribute errors and warnings as you type. For instance, processors can red-squiggle
    a bad annotation value to indicate a semantic problem that the compiler alone would not be able to discover.
    However, some annotation processors are slow enough that running them in the editor interferes with
    the usability of the editor. In this situation, disabling this option can improve performance of 
    the editor. Processors will still run whenever the project is built. This option does not apply to
    Java 6 annotation processors, which Eclipse can (for now) only run during a build.</p>
    <h2>
    	Generated Source Directory
    </h2>
    <p>Files will be generated on disk relative to the specified directory.  By default this directory
    is named &quot;.apt_generated&quot;, which since it starts with a '.' causes it to be filtered out 
    of the Package Explorer view.  
    Generated files have the &quot;derived&quot; bit set; when a project is cleaned, all derived files under the
    generated source directory will be removed.  It is recommended to only
    use this directory for files generated by processors; do not place any manually created files under
    this directory, and do not use a pre-existing directory as the generated source directory.</p>
    <h2>
    	Processor Options
    </h2>
    <p>Options entered here will be available via the AnnotationProcessorEnvironment interface (for Java
    5 processors) or the ProcessingEnvironment interface (for Java 6 processors).  
    Certain options such as <code>-classpath</code> and <code>-sourcepath</code> are automatically provided to 
    Java 5 processors; entering them in this dialog will have no effect, since the automatically provided values 
    will override any values set here. For Java 6 processors, the values of these automatic options are made 
    available as variables such as <code>%classpath%</code> and <code>%sourcepath%</code>. The automatic options 
    are described <a href="ref-apt-automaticProcessorOptions.htm">here</a>. More information about processor options 
    is in the topic on <a href="ref-apt-processorOptionsInput.htm">the Processor Options input dialog</a>.</p>
