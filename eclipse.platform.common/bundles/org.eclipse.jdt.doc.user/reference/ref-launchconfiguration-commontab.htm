		The <strong>Common Tab</strong> is a tab that is available for many
		different launch configuration types. It defines general aspects of
		the launch configuration including storage location, output handling,

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Save as</td>
				<td>A launch configuration is saved as an XML <i>.launch</i>
					file on disk. By default, if <strong>Local file</strong> is
					selected, this file is saved in the <i>${workspace_loc}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches</i>
					directory, where <i>${workspace_loc}</i> denotes the workspace
					location. <br /> If you want to share a launch configuration with
					team members, you have the option to save it as a <strong>Shared
						file</strong> in one of your workspace projects (in order to make it
					visible for version control).
				</td>
				<td>Local file</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Display in favorites menu</td>
				<td>In this list you can select in what kind of launch type
					favorites menu this launch should be displayed</td>
				<td>None selected</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Encoding</td>
				<td>Sets the encoding for the console allocated for this
					launch. If <strong>Default</strong> is selected the launch will
					inherit the current <i>Text file encoding</i> setting from the <a
					href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-9.htm">Workspace
						preference page</a>. Or a different encoding can be selected for this
					launch.
				</td>
				<td>Default</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Allocate console</td>
				<td>If enabled the launch will allocate a <a
					href="views/console/ref-console_view.htm">Console View</a> to show
					the output from the launched process and to receive user input
					which is then send to the launched process. <br /> <strong>Note:</strong>
					allocating a console is even required if input is provided from a
					file or output should be written to a file. If no console is
					allocated input and output from/to the launched process is ignored.
					<br /> Also if the launch is not attached to a debugger and no
					console is allocated there may be no way to kill the launched
					process from within Eclipse since the termination action button is
					provided by the Console View.
				</td>
				<td>On</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Input File</td>
				<td>If enabled the user input in console will be disabled and
					instead the content of the specified file send as input to the
					launched process.</td>
				<td>Off</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Output File</td>
				<td>If enabled all output received from the launched process
					will be written to the specified file. (in addition to be shown in
					the Console View)<br />If <strong>Append</strong> is enabled the
					output file will be created or appended if it already exist. If <strong>Append</strong>
					is disabled an already existing output file will be truncated
					before output from the new launch is written to it.
				</td>
				<td>Off</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Merge standard and error output</td>
				<td>If enabled the launched process will merge standard output
					and error output from the launched process. This ensures the
					Console View shows the standard and error output in the same order
					it is produced by the launched process. <br /> If output is merged
					it is no longer possible for the console to distinguish between
					standard and error output and therefore not possible to show error
					output in a different color. <br /> This option is only available
					if the launch type support it.
				</td>
				<td>Off</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Launch in Background</td>
				<td>If enabled the launching is performed in background. The
					effect of this option depend on the concrete launch type. In many
					cases the launch will spawn a new sub process which run in
					background regardless of this option. Only the launch process
					itself is affected by this option.</td>
				<td>On</td>
