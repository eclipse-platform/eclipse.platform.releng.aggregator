<h1>Show Supported Breakpoints</h1>
<p>Select the <strong>Show Supported Breakpoints</strong> command [ <img src="../../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/obj16/debugt_obj.svg" alt="Show Supported Breakpoints"> ] to indicate if only breakpoints applicable to the current debug target should be visible in the <a href="../../../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm"><strong>Breakpoints View</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Example: If you have C/C++ and Java breakpoints, with this option turned on you will only see those breakpoints applicable to what you are currently debugging. Meaning that when you are debugging a Java program the <strong>Breakpoints View</strong> will only display Java breakpoints.</p>
