    <h1>
      Filtering in Java Views
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Applying View Filters
    </h2>
    <p>
      All Java views allow to filter the displayed Java elements. The set of available filters
      depends on the view.
    </p>

    <p>
      To filter elements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the view toolbar, click the <strong>Menu</strong> button and choose
      <strong>Filters...</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>Select or clear the filters that you want to apply to the view (read <strong>Filter
      description</strong> to learn about the selected filter's functionality).
      </li>

      <li>Optionally, you can select patterns for filtering the view:
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>Name filter patterns</strong> checkbox at the top of the dialog.
          </li>
          <li>In the text field below, specify the desired patterns (names matching one of the
          patterns will be hidden).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Filtering Members
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several Java views (e.g. <strong>Outline</strong>, <strong>Type Hierarchy</strong>,
      <strong>Members</strong>) offer filtering of members (fields, types and methods). The filters
      are available as toolbar buttons or as view menu items, depending on the view. There are 3
      member filters:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>
        <span class="control">Hide Fields</span>: when activated, this filter causes all fields to
        be removed from the view.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="control">Hide Static Fields and Methods</span>: when activated, this filter
        causes all static members to be removed from the view.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="control">Hide Non-Public Members</span>: when activated, this filter causes
        all non-public members to be removed from the view.
      </li>

    </ul>Additionally, the <strong>Package Explorer</strong> view can display or hide all elements
    inside compilation units.
    <p>
      To show or hide members in the <strong>Package Explorer</strong> view, select or clear the
      <span class="control">Show members in Package Explorer</span> checkbox in the <a class=
      "command-link" href=
      'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.jdt.ui.preferences.AppearancePreferencePage)")'>
      <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt=
      "Opens the Appearance preference page" /> <span class="control">Java &gt;

      Appearance</span></a> preference page.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Filtering Working Sets
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several Java views (e.g. <strong>Package Explorer</strong>, <strong>Type Hierarchy</strong>)
      offer to filter by one or more working sets. The filters are available in the view menu. Only
      the elements that are contained in the selected working sets are shown in the view.
