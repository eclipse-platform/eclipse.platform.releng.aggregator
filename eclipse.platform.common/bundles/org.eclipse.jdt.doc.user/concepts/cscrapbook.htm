    <h1>Scrapbook</h1>
    <p>The Java development toolkit (JDT) contributes a scrapbook facility that can be used to experiment and evaluate Java
    code snippets before building a complete Java program. Snippets are edited and evaluated in the Scrapbook page
    editor, with resultant problems reported in the editor.</p>

    <p>From a Java scrapbook editor, you can select a code snippet, evaluate it, and display the result as a string.
    You can also show the object that results from evaluating a code snippet in the debuggers' <a href="../reference/views/expressions/ref-expressions_view.htm"><strong>Expressions View</strong></a>.</p>
