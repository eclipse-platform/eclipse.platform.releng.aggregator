    <h1>
      Refactoring Support
    </h1>
    <p>
      The goal of Java program refactoring is to make system-wide code changes without affecting
      the behavior of the program. The Java tools provide assistance in easily refactoring code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The refactoring tools support a number of transformations described in Martin Fowler's book
      <span class="name">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</span>, Addison Wesley
      1999, such as <span class="name">Extract Method</span>, <span class="name">Inline Local
      Variable, etc.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get an overview of all offered refactorings look at the <a href=
      "../reference/ref-menu-refactor.htm"><b>Refactor menu</b></a>. Refactoring commands are also
      available from the context menus in many views or appear as <a href=
      "../reference/ref-java-editor-quickassist.htm"><b>quick assists</b></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When performing a refactoring operation, you can optionally preview all of the changes
      resulting from a refactoring action before you choose to carry them out. When previewing a
      refactoring operation, you will be notified of potential problems and will be presented with
      a list of the changes the refactoring action will perform. If you do not preview a
      refactoring operation, the change will be made in its entirety and any resultant problems
      will be shown. If a problem is detected that does not allow the refactoring to continue, the
      operation will be halted and a list of problems will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refactoring commands are available from the context menus of several Java views (e.g. Package
      Explorer, Outline) and editors. Many "apparently simple" commands, such as
      <strong>Move</strong> and <strong>Rename</strong>, are actually refactoring operations, since
      moving and renaming Java elements often require changes in dependent files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Refactorings can not only be performed interactively, but also from refactoring scripts. Most
      refactorings available in the <strong>Refactor</strong> menu are stored in the workspace
      refactoring history in order to be used in refactoring scripts afterwards. The refactoring
      tools support the creation of refactoring scripts based on refactorings in the workspace
      refactoring history. Refactoring scripts can then be applied to an arbitrary workspace.
      Applying a refactoring script launches a refactoring wizard which is able to replay the
      refactorings as if they had been initiated by the user which originally had created them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Related to refactoring scripts, the refactoring tools offer a refactoring to migrate a JAR
      File to a newer version, using refactoring information to avoid breaking changes in your
      workspace after the migration.
