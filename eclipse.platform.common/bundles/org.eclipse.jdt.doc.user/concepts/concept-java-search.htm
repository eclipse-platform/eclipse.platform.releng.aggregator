    <h1>
      Java Search
    </h1>
    <p>
      <span>The Java searching support allows you to find declarations, references and occurrences
      of Java elements (packages, types, methods, fields). Searching is supported by an index that
      is kept up to date in the background as the resources corresponding to Java elements are
      changed. The Java search operates on workspaces independent of their build state. For
      example, searches can be conducted when auto-build is turned off.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following searches can be initiated from the pop-up menus of Java elements or from the
      Java search dialog:
