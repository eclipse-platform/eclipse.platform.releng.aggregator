    <h1>
      Writing and Running JUnit Tests
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this section, you will be using the <a href="http://www.junit.org"
      target="_blank">JUnit</a> testing framework to write and run tests. To
      get started with JUnit you can refer to the <a href=
      "http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm" target=
      "_blank">JUnit Cookbook</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Writing Tests
    </h2>
    <p>
      Create a project "JUnitTest". Now you can write your first test. You
      implement the test in a subclass of <strong>TestCase</strong>. You can do
      so either using the standard Class wizard or the specialized <strong>Test
      Case</strong> wizard:
    </p>
    <ol>

      <li>Open the New wizard (<strong>File &gt; New &gt; JUnit Test
      Case</strong>).
      </li>
      <li>Select <strong>New JUnit 3 test</strong> and enter
      "<i>TestFailure"</i> as the name of your test class:
        <p>

          <img src="images/wiz_new_testcase.png" alt=
          "TestCase creation wizard page 1" /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> If you want to use JUnit 4 tests you have to make sure
          that your compiler compliance is set to 1.5.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>You will see a warning message asking you to add the junit library to
      the build path. Use the <strong>Click here</strong> link to add the junit
      library automatically.
      </li>

      <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to create the test class.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Add a test method that fails to the class <i>TestFailure</i>. A quick way
      to enter a test method is with the <i>test</i> template. To do so, place
      the cursor inside the class declaration. Type "test" followed by
      <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> to activate code assist and select the "test"
      template. Change the name of the created method to <i>testFailure</i> and
      invoke the <i>fail()</i> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>public void testFailure() throws Exception {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fail();<br />
      }</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you are ready to run your first test.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Running Tests
    </h2>
    <p>
      To run TestFailure hit the run button in the toolbar. It will
      automatically run as JUnit Test. You can inspect the test results in the
      <i>JUnit</i> view. This view shows you the test run progress and status:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/view_junit_red.png" alt="Failed test" />

    </p>
    <p>
      The view is shown in the current perspective whenever you start a test
      run. A convenient arrangement for the JUnit view is to dock it as a fast
      view. The JUnit view has two tabs: one shows you a list of failures and
      the other shows you the full test suite as a tree. You can navigate from
      a failure to the corresponding source by double clicking the
      corresponding line in the failure trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dock the JUnit view as a fast view, remove the <i>fail()</i> statement in
      the method <i>testFailure()</i> so that the test passes and rerun the
      test again. You can rerun a test either by clicking the <b>Rerun</b>

      button in the view's tool bar or you can re-run the program that was last
      launched by activating the <b>Run</b> drop down. This time the test
      should succeed. Because the test was successful, the JUnit view doesn't
      pop up, but the success indicator shows on the JUnit view icon and the
      status line shows the test result. As a reminder to rerun your tests the
      view icon is decorated by a "*" whenever you change the workspace
      contents after the run.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <img src="images/icon_junit_successfull.png" alt=
        "Successful test" /> - A successful test run<br />
        <img src="images/icon_junit_successfull_workspace_modifed.png" alt="Successful test but workspace has changed" /> - A successful
        test run, but the workspace contents have changed since the last test
        run.
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In addition to running a test case as described above you can also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run all tests inside a project, source folder, or package -
      &nbsp;<br />
        Select a project, package or source folder and run all the included
        tests with <strong>Run as &gt; JUnit Test</strong>. This command finds
        all tests inside a project, source folder or package and executes them.
      </li>

      <li>Run a single test method -<br />
        Select a test method in the Outline or Package Explorer and with
        <strong>Run as &gt; JUnit Test</strong> the selected test method will
        be run.
      </li>
      <li>Rerun a single test -<br />
        Select a test in the JUnit view and execute <b>Run</b> from the context
        menu.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>
      Customizing a Test Configuration
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you want to pass parameters or customize the settings for a test run
      you open the Launch Configuration Dialog. Select <strong>Open Run
      Dialog...</strong>.in the <strong>Run</strong> drop-down menu in the
      toolbar:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/run_dialog_junit.png" alt=
      "JUnit Launch Configuration" />
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dialog you can specify the test to be run, its arguments, its
      run-time class path, and the Java run-time environment.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Debugging a Test Failure
    </h2>
    <p>

      In the case of a test failure you can follow these steps to debug it:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Double click the failure entry from the Failures tab in the JUnit
      view to open the corresponding file in the editor.
      </li>
      <li>Set a breakpoint at the beginning of the test method.
      </li>
      <li>Select the test case and execute&nbsp; <b>Debug As&gt;JUnit Test</b>

      from the <b>Debug</b> drop down.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A JUnit launch configuration has a "keep alive" option. If your Java
      virtual machine supports "hot code replacement" you can fix the code and
      rerun the test without restarting the full test run. To enable this
      option select the <strong>Keep JUnit running after a test run when
      debugging</strong> checkbox in the JUnit launch configuration.
    </p>
    <h2>

      Creating a Test Suite
    </h2>
    <p>
      The JUnit <b>TestSuite</b> wizard helps you with the creation of a test
      suite. You can select the set of classes that should belong to a suite.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the New wizard
      </li>
      <li>Select <strong>Java &gt; JUnit &gt; JUnit Test Suite</strong> and
      click <strong>Next</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>Enter a name for your test suite class (the convention is to use
      "AllTests" which appears by default).<br />
        <p>
          <img src="images/wiz_new_suite.png" alt="Test Suite wizard" />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Select the classes that should be included in the suite. We currently
      have a single test class only, but you can add to the suite later.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>

      You can add or remove test classes from the test suite in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manually by editing the test suite file
      </li>
      <li>By re-running the wizard and selecting the new set of test classes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: the wizard puts 2 markers, <code>//$JUnit-BEGIN$</code> and
      <code>//$JUnit-END$</code>, into the created Test suite class, which
      allows the wizard to update existing test suite classes. Editing code
      between the markers is not recommended.
