      The JDT project provides the tool plug-ins that implement a
      Java IDE supporting the development of any Java application,
      including Eclipse plug-ins. It adds a Java project nature and
      Java perspective to the Eclipse Workbench as well as a number
      of views, editors, wizards, builders, and code merging and
      refactoring tools. The JDT project allows Eclipse to be a
      development environment for itself.
