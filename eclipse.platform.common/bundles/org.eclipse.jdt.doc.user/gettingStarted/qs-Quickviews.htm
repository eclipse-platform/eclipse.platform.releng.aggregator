<h1> Using Quick Views </h1>
<p> 
In this section, you will be introduced to the quick outline view. Quick views are in-place views which 
are shown on top of the editor area and can easily be controlled using the keyboard. A second quick view will
be introduced in the <a href="qs-6.htm#quick_type_hierarchy">Type Hierarchy section</a>.
</p>
<h2>Quick Outline <a id="quick_outline"></a></h2>
<p>To use the quick outline view in the Java editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open 
<em>junit.samples.VectorTest.java</em> file in the Java editor 
if you do not already have it open.</li>
<li> Press <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> or select <strong>Navigate &gt; Quick Outline</strong> and 
you will see an in-place outline of the current source file. <br>

<li>Press <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> a second time and all inherited fields, 
types and methods are shown as well (for the types marked with <img src="../images/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/ovr16/focus_ovr.svg" alt="Triangle"> on the left).
Inherited members are shown in blue. </li>

<li>Start typing while the quick outline view is shown to filter the list of displayed elements.
Further, use the arrow keys to navigate in the outline view
and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to reveal the selected element in the Java editor. <br>

<br>
The menu items can be divided into 3 categories:
<ul>
<li><em>Position</em> - Allows you to resize and move the quick view and to remember these settings</li>
<li><em>Filter</em> - Define filters so that not all members are shown in the quick outline.</li>
<li><em>Sort</em> - Sort the members by their defining type or alphabetically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> always opens the outline for the current Java editor.
Press <kbd>Ctrl+F3</kbd> to open the quick outline for the currently selected type.
