    <h1>
      Using the Local History
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this section, you will use the local history feature to switch to a previously saved version of an individual 
      Java element.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open <em>junit.samples/VectorTest.java</em> file in the Java editor and select the method
        <em>testCapacity()</em> in the Outline view.
      </li>
      <li>
      	Change the content of the method so that the 'for' statements reads as:<br>
      	<p><code>
      	for (int i= 0; i &lt; 99; i++)
      	</code></p>
	    Save the file by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Outline view, select the method <code>testCapacity()</code>, and from its context menu, select <strong>Replace
        With &gt; Element from Local History</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong>Replace Java Element from Local History</strong> dialog, the Local History list 
        shows the various saved states of the method. The Java Source Compare pane shows details of the 
        differences between the selected history resource and the existing workbench resource.

      </li>
      <li>
       In the top pane, select the previous version, and click the <strong> Replace 
       button</strong>. In the Java editor, the method is replaced with the selected history version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beside replacing a method's version with a previous one you can also restore Java elements that were 
        deleted. Again, select the method <em>testCapacity()</em> in the Outline view, and from its context
        menu, select <strong>Delete</strong>. Confirm the resulting dialog with <strong>Yes</strong> and
        save the file. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Now select the type <em>VectorTest</em> in the Outline view, and from its context menu, select
        <strong>Restore from Local History...</strong>. Select and check the method <em>testCapacity()</em>
        in the Available Java Elements pane. As before, the Local History pane shows the versions saved 
        in the local history.

      <li>
        In the Local History pane, select the earlier working version and then click <strong>Restore</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>
