      Removing Line Breakpoints
    </h1>
    <p>
      Breakpoints can be easily removed when you no longer need them.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the editor area, open the file where you want to remove the breakpoint.
      </li>
      
  <li> Directly to the left of the line where you want to remove the breakpoint, 
    open the marker bar pop-up menu and select <strong>Toggle Breakpoint</strong>. 
    The breakpoint is removed from the workbench.&nbsp; You can also double-click 
    directly on the breakpoint icon to remove it. </li>
    </ol>
    Breakpoints can also be removed in the <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm">Breakpoints View</a></strong>. Select the breakpoint(s) to be removed and from the context menu select <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-remove_viewaction.htm">Remove</a></strong>.<br>
     All breakpoints can be removed from the workbench using the <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-removeall_viewaction.htm">Remove All</a></strong> action in the context menu of the <strong>Breakpoints View</strong>.
     <p>If you find yourself frequently adding and removing a breakpoint in the
    same place, consider disabling the breakpoint when you don't need it (using <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-disable_contextaction.htm">Disable
    Breakpoint</a> </strong>in the breakpoint context menu or the <strong>Breakpoints View</strong>)
    and enabling it when needed again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
