      Using the Local History
    </h1>
    <p>
      The JDT extends the workbench concept of a local history in three ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A file can be replaced with an edition from the local history in the
      Package Explorer view.
      </li>

      <li>The JDT allows you to compare and/or replace individual Java elements
      (types and their members) with editions from the local history.
      </li>
      <li>The JDT allows you to restore Java elements (and files) deleted from
      the workbench that have been kept in the local history.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: Files and Java elements such as types and their members change in
      time. A 'snapshot' of what they look like a point in time (as saved in
      the local history) is called an edition.
    </p>
