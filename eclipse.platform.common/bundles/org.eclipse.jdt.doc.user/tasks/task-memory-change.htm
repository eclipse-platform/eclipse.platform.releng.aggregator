<h1>Changing the Contents of a Memory Location</h1>

  <p>To change the contents of a memory location in a memory monitor in the Memory view:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the <strong>Monitors</strong> pane, select the memory monitor that contains the memory location that you want to edit. Memory will appear in the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane, where you will perform all other steps. If you have added multiple renderings, select the tab that contains the rendering that you want to edit.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the memory location you want to change. Alternatively, right-click in the monitor and choose the <strong>Go to Address</strong> pop-up menu item. This will open a Go To Address section at the bottom of the rendering, in which you can enter an address that you want to jump to.</li>
    <li>Select the row containing the value that you want to change and then double-click the value that you want to change.
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the rendering is currently in focus, you do not need to double-click the value that you want to change to be able to edit it. Rather, you can simply start typing the change and the editor will activate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Enter a valid value for that memory location.</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> to submit the change. The debugger checks for a valid value.</li>
  </ol>
