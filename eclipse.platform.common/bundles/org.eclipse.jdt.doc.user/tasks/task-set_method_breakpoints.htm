    <h1>
      Setting Method Breakpoints
    </h1>
    <p>
      Method breakpoints are used when working with types that have no source
    code (binary types).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the class in the <strong>Outline View</strong>, and select the method where you want to add a method breakpoint.      </li>
      
      <li> From the method's pop-up menu, select <strong>Toggle Method Breakpoint</strong>. 
  </li>
      <li>
        A breakpoint appears in the <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm"><strong>Breakpoints View</strong></a>. If source exists for the class, then a breakpoint also appears in the marker bar in the file's editor for the method that
        was selected.      </li>
      <li>
        While the breakpoint is enabled, thread execution suspends when the method is entered, before any line in the method is executed.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Method breakpoints can also be setup to break on method exit.&nbsp; In the Breakpoints view, select the breakpoint and toggle the
    <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-exit_contextaction.htm">Exit</a></strong>&nbsp; item in its context menu.</p>
    <p>Method breakpoints can be <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-remove_viewaction.htm">removed</a>, <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-enable_contextaction.htm">enabled</a>, and <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-disable_contextaction.htm">disabled</a> just like line
    breakpoints.</p>
