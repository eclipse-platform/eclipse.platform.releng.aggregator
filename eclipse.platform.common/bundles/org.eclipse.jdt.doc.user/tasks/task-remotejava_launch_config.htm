<h1> Using the Remote Java Application Launch Configuration </h1>
<p>The <strong>Remote Java Application </strong> launch configuration should
  be used when debugging an application that is running on a remote VM.&nbsp;
  Since the application is started on the remote system, the launch configuration
  does not specify the usual information about the JRE, program arguments, or
  VM arguments.&nbsp; Instead, information about connecting to the application
  is supplied. </p>
<p>To create a <strong>Remote Java Application</strong> launch configuration,
  do the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Select <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations")'> <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="Opens the Debug Launch Configuration dialog"> <strong>Run &gt; Debug Configurations...</strong></a> from
    the workbench menu bar (or <strong>Debug Configurations...</strong> from the drop-down menu
    on the <strong>Debug</strong> tool bar button) to show the launch configuration
    dialog. </li>
  <li> Select the <strong>Remote Java Application</strong> in the list of configuration
    types on the left. </li>
  <li> Click the <strong>New</strong> toolbar button. A new remote launch configuration
    is created and three tabs are shown: <strong>Connect</strong>, <strong>Source</strong>,
    and <strong>Common</strong>. </li>
  <li> In the <strong>Project</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong> tab,
    type or browse to select the project to use as a reference for the launch
    (for source lookup). A project does not need to be specified. </li>
  <li> The <strong>Connection Type</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong> tab
    allows you to choose how you will connect to the virtual machine. In most
    cases, you will be attaching to the VM at a specific location, in which case
    select <em>Standard (Socket Attach)</em>.
    <ul>
      <li> In the <strong>Host</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong> tab,
        type the IP address or domain name of the host where the Java program is
        running.<br>
        If the program is running on the same machine as the workbench, type <em>localhost</em>. </li>
      <li> In the <strong>Port</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong> tab,
        type the port where the remote VM is accepting connections. Generally, this
        port is specified when the remote VM is launched. </li>
    </ul>
    The <em>Standard (Socket Listen)</em> connection type listens
    for incoming connections from a remote VM.  It is typically used
    for debugging an application that spans multiple VMs, such
    as a distributed system.
    <ul>
      <li> In the <strong>Port</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong> tab,
        type the port on your local machine where the remote VM should
        connect to. Generally, your host and this port is specified
        when the remote VM is launched.</li>
       <li> In the <strong>Connection limit</strong> field of the <strong>Connect</strong>
        tab, type the number of expected connections, or
        <tt>0</tt> to support an unlimited number of connections.</li>
    </ul>
  <li> The <strong>Allow termination of remote VM</strong> flag is a toggle that
    determines whether the <strong>Terminate</strong> command is enabled in the
    debugger. Select this option if you want to be able to terminate the VM to
    which you are connecting. </li>
  <li> Click <strong>Debug</strong>. The launch attempts to connect to a VM at
    the specified address and port, and the result is displayed in the Debug
    view. If the launcher is unable to connect to a VM at the specified address,
    an error message appears. </li>
</ol>
<p>Specific instructions for setting up the remote VM should be obtained from
  your VM provider.&nbsp;</p>
