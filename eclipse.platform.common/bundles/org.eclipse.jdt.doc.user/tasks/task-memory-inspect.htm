<h1>Inspecting Memory in the Memory View</h1>

  <p>With the Memory view, you can look at the contents of memory at a specific address. The address can be obtained from an expression that references a variable or a register. When you monitor memory, you can set the monitor to be rendered in various data formats.</p>

  <p>The Memory view is comprised of two portions:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Monitors</strong> pane is located on the left-hand side of the view. This portion of the view contains a list of expressions, variables, and registers that you have added for monitoring.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Renderings</strong> pane is located on the right-hand side of the view (if the view is set to horizontal orientation). You use it to set the data format (or formats) that you want displayed for monitored memory.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When you monitor an address or expression from the <strong>Monitors</strong> pane, the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane becomes populated with a set of default renderings provided by your debugger. When you monitor an address or expression from the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane, the pane becomes populated with a list of renderings from which you can choose one to display.</p>
  
  <p>You can monitor multiple variables, expressions, and registers in the Memory view - and you can add multiple renderings to the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane. In the <strong>Monitors</strong> pane, each variable, expression, or register that you have added is listed. In the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane, only the memory rendering(s) for the currently-selected monitor in the Memory view is displayed (multiple renderings are separated by tabs or a split pane).</p>
  
  <p>You can set the two panes in the Memory view to display in a horizontal orientation (side-by-side) or in a vertical orientation (top-to-bottom). To set the layout of the view, click the Memory view down-arrow icon and select <strong>Layout</strong> from the menu. This will open a submenu, from which you can choose the orientation that you want to display.</p>
