<h1> Managing Conditional Breakpoints </h1>
<p> 
      A conditional expression can be applied to a line breakpoint or a watchpoint such that the
      breakpoint suspends execution of a thread in one of these cases: </p>
<ul>
  <li>when the result of the expression is true</li>
  <li>when the result of the expression changes</li>
</ul>
<p>A conditional expression can contain arbitrary Java code and may contain more than one statement, allowing breakpoint conditions to implement features like tracing. For example, a condition can execute a print statement and then return a hard coded value to never suspend (&quot;<code>System.out.println(...); return false;</code>&quot;).</p>
<p>To set a condition on a breakpoint: </p>
<ol>
      <li>
        Find the breakpoint to which an enabling condition is to be applied (in
        the <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm"><strong>Breakpoints View</strong></a> or in the editor marker bar).      </li>
      <li>
        From the breakpoint's pop-up menu, select <strong><a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-properties_contextaction.htm">Breakpoint
        Properties...</a></strong>.&nbsp; The Breakpoint properties dialog will open.      </li>
  <li> In the properties dialog, check the <strong><a href="../reference/breakpoints/ref-condition_option.htm">Enable Condition</a></strong> checkbox.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> In the <strong><a href="../reference/breakpoints/ref-condition_option.htm">Condition</a></strong> field enter the expression for 
    the breakpoint condition. </li>
  <li> Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>If you want the breakpoint to stop every time the condition evaluates
        to <em>true</em>, select the <strong>condition is 'true' </strong>option.&nbsp;
        The expression provided must be a boolean expression.</li>
      <li>If you want the breakpoint to stop only when the result of the
        condition changes, select the <strong>value of condition changes </strong>option.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
  <li> Select <strong>OK</strong> to close the dialog and commit the changes. While 
    the breakpoint is enabled, thread execution suspends before that line of code 
    is executed if the breakpoint condition evaluates to <em>true</em>.&nbsp; 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
    A conditional breakpoint has a question mark overlay on the breakpoint icon.</p>
