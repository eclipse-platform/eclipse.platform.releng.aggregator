      Opening an Editor on a Type
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can open an editor on any type in the workbench.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+T</strong> or, select
      <strong>Navigate</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Type</strong> from the menu
      bar. The Open Type dialog opens.
      </li>

      <li>In the <strong>Enter type name prefix or pattern</strong> field,
      begin typing an expression to narrow the list of available types, using
      wildcards as needed. As you type, the list is filtered to display only
      types that match the current expression. CamelCase notation is also
      supported; that means you only need to enter the capital letters of the
      type name.
      </li>
      <li>In the <strong>Matching items</strong> list, select a type. Hint: you
      can press the <strong>Down</strong> key to move to the first type.
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done. An editor opens on the
      selected type.
      </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Open Type dialog maintains a history of
      recently opened types. These are shown when the dialog is opened and stay
      above a separator line when you start to type a filter expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you open a type from a CLASS or JAR file, you
      will see a special editor showing only method signatures unless you have
      attached source to it.
    </p>
