    <p>
      You can select the name of a type, method, or field in the Java source
      editor or in the scrapbook and open an editor on the definition of the
      element.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the Java editor, select the name of a type, method, or field. You
      can also just click into the name once.
      </li>

      <li>Do one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>From the menu bar, select <strong>Navigate</strong> &gt; <strong>
            Open Declaration</strong>
          </li>
          <li>From the editor's pop-up menu, select <strong>Open
          Declaration</strong>

          </li>
          <li>Press <strong>F3</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      or
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Hold down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key.
      </li>
      <li>In the Java editor, move the mouse over the name of a type, method,
      or field until the name becomes underlined.
      </li>
      <li>Click the hyperlink once.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>

      If there are multiple definitions of the same name, a dialog is shown,
      and you can select one definition that you want to open. An editor opens
      containing the selected element.
