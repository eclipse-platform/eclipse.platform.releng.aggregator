    <h1>
      Catching Java Exceptions
    </h1>
    <p>
      It is possible to suspend the execution of thread when an exception is thrown by specifying an
      exception breakpoint. Execution can be suspended at locations where the exception is
      uncaught, caught, or both.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose <strong>Add Java Exception Breakpoint</strong>  from the
        <a href="../reference/views/breakpoints/ref-breakpoints_view.htm"><strong>Breakpoints View</strong></a> or the workbench <strong>Run</strong> menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;      </li>
      <li>
        A dialog listing all of the available exceptions is presented (see the following figure).<br>
        <br>

        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Type the name of the exception you want to catch or select it from the list.      </li>
      <li>
        At the bottom of the page, use the checkboxes to specify how you want execution to suspend at locations where the exception is thrown. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select <strong>Caught</strong> if you want execution to suspend at locations where the exception
            is thrown and caught by a <code>catch</code> clause.          </li>
          <li>
            Select <strong>Uncaught</strong> if you want execution to suspend at locations where the exception is uncaught.          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Exception breakpoints can be enabled and disabled and have hit counts
    just like regular breakpoints.
