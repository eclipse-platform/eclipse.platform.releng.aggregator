      Opening a Type in the Package Explorer View
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can open the Package Explorer on any type that is included on a
      project's class path.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the menu bar, select <strong>Navigate &gt; Go To &gt;

      Type.</strong> The Go to Type dialog opens.
      </li>
      <li>In the <strong>Choose a type</strong> field, begin typing an
      expression to narrow the list of available types, using wildcards as
      needed. As you type, the list is filtered to display only types that
      match the current expression.
      </li>
      <li>In the <strong>Matching items</strong> list, select a type. Hint: you
      can press the <strong>Down</strong> key to move to the first type.
      </li>

      <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done. The selected type is
      displayed in the Package Explorer.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Goto Type dialog maintains a history of
      recently opened types. These are shown when the dialog is opened and stay
      above a separator line when you start to type a filter expression.
    </p>
    <p>

      <strong>Note:</strong> Revealing may not be possible if Package Explorer
      filters are applied.
    </p>
