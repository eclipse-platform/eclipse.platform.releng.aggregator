      Creating a Java Application Launch Configuration
    </h1>
    <p>
      When you choose <strong>Run &gt;Run As &gt;Java Application</strong> to
      launch your class, you are running your class using a generic
      <strong>Java Application</strong> launch configuration that derives most
      of the launch parameters from your Java project and your workbench
      preferences.&nbsp; In some cases, you will want to override the derived
      parameters or specify additional arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      You do this by creating your own <strong>Java Application</strong> launch
      configuration.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <a class="command-link" href=
      'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenRunConfigurations")'>
        <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt=
        "Opens the Run Launch Configurations dialog" /> <strong>Run &gt; Run
        Configurations...</strong></a> or <a class="command-link" href=
        'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations")'>

        <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt=
        "Opens the Debug Launch Configurations dialog" /> <strong>Run &gt;
        Debug Configurations...</strong></a> from the workbench menu bar.&nbsp;
        This opens a dialog that lets you create, modify, and delete launch
        configurations of different types.
      </li>
      <li>Select <strong>Java Application</strong> in the left hand list of
      launch configuration types, and press the <strong>New</strong> button in
      the toolbar. This will create a new launch configuration for a Java
      application.&nbsp;The tabs on the right hand side allow you control
      specific aspects of the launch.
      </li>

    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Main</strong> tab defines the class to be launched.
        Enter the name of the project containing the class to launch in the
        project field, and the fully qualified name of the main class in the
        Main class field.&nbsp;Check the <strong>Stop in main</strong> checkbox
        if you want the program to stop in the main method whenever the program
        is launched in debug mode.<br />
          Note:&nbsp; You do not have to specify a project, but doing so allows
          a default classpath, source lookup path, and JRE to be chosen.
        </li>

        <li>The <strong>Arguments</strong> tab defines the arguments to be
        passed to the application and to the virtual machine (if any). You can
        also specify the working directory to be used by the launched
        application.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>JRE</strong> tab defines the JRE used to run or debug
        the application. You can select a JRE from the already defined JREs, or
        define a new JRE.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>Classpath</strong> tab defines the location of class
        files used when running or debugging an application. By default, the
        user and bootstrap class locations are derived from the associated
        project's build path. You may override these settings here.
        </li>

        <li>The <strong>Source</strong> tab defines the location of source
        files used to display source when debugging a Java application. By
        default, these settings are derived from the associated project's build
        path. You may override these settings here.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>Environment</strong> tab defines the environment
        variable values to use when running or debugging a Java application. By
        default, the environment is inherited from the Eclipse runtime. You may
        override or append to the inherited environment. Variables specified in
        the tab always replace values in the underlying native environment.
        However, when "Append environment to native environment" is selected
        the launched environment is seeded with the native environment, after
        which variables in the tab replace (existing variables) or augment the
        set of environment variables. When "Replace native environment with
        specified environment" is selected, the launched environment is
        comprised only of the variables specified in the tab.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>Common</strong> tab defines general information about
        the launch configuration.&nbsp; You may choose to store the launch
        configuration in a specific file and specify which perspectives become
        active when the launch configuration is launched.
        </li>

      </ul>
