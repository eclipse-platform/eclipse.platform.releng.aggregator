    <title>Adding a variable, expression, or register to the Memory view</title>
  </head>

<h1>Adding a Variable, Expression, or Register to the Memory View</h1>

  <p>You can add a register, variable name, or expression (such as a raw address, for example, 0x00000234) to a memory monitor from the Memory view.</p>

  <p>To add a new memory monitor from the Memory view:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click the Memory view <strong>Add Memory Monitor</strong> push button (<img src="images/task-memory-add-monitor.gif" alt="Add Memory Monitor button">). This button is located in the <strong>Monitors</strong> pane.</li>
    <li>In the  Monitor Memory dialog box, enter the address or expression in the field (expressions must evaluate to an address). This entry does not need to be case-sensitive. Alternatively, if you have previously monitored the address or expression when debugging this application, choose it from the pull down list. Depending on the debug engine that the debugger user interface is connected to, examples of valid expressions include register names, variables, and HEX addresses.
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> When adding a register to a memory monitor, the Registers view is a convenient location to see the names of all registers in your application. You can make note of the name of a register from the view and then use it when adding a memory monitor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>After adding the new memory monitor you can choose the memory format that you want to display in the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane.</p>
  
  <p>You can also add a new memory monitor from the Memory view <strong>Renderings</strong> pane:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Click the Memory view <strong>Add Rendering(s)</strong> push button (<img alt="Add Memory Monitor button" src="images/task-memory-add-monitor.gif">). This button is located in the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane.</li>
    <li>In the Add Memory Rendering dialog box, select an existing memory monitor from the pull-down list - or add a new memory monitor by clicking <strong>Add New</strong>. If you add a new memory monitor, you will be prompted via the Monitor Memory dialog box to enter an address or expression to monitor. Click <strong>OK</strong> to return to the Add Memory Rendering dialog box.</li>
    <li>Do one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Select the memory rendering that you want to display for the memory monitor and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong> and then choose the memory rendering that you want to display right from the <strong>Renderings</strong> pane.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
