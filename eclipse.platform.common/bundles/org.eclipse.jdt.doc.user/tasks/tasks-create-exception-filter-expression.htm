    <h1>
      Create Exception Breakpoint Filtering    </h1>
    <p>
      Type name and package name filtering can be set up for Java exception breakpoints. This can be done from an exception breakpoints' <strong>Filtering</strong> properties page, as shown in the following figure.</p>
    <p><img src="../tasks/images/tasks-excetpion-filtering-page.PNG" alt="Java Breakpoint Exception Filtering Properties Page"></p>
    <p>Using the Filtering properties page there are four ways to add filtering for a Java exception breakpoint:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can select specific threads to restrict the breakpoint to (which must be done while in a debug session)</li>
      <li>You can use the <strong>Add Class</strong> button to select a class via the <a href="../reference/ref-dialog-type-selection.htm">Type Selection Dialog</a></li>
      <li>You can use the <strong>Add Package</strong> button to select a  package using a filtered <a href="../reference/ref-dialog-type-selection.htm">Type Selection Dialog</a></li>
      <li>You can use the<strong> Add </strong>button to define your own pattern to match as a class and/or package filter</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Defining Your Own Filter Pattern</h2>
    <p>Using the Add button mentioned above, you can define your own pattern to be used as a filter for a Java exception breakpoint. Once pressed, you can then<br>
  enter any expression in the new space in the <strong>Selected Locations</strong> list, as shown in the following figure.</p>
    <p><img src="../tasks/images/tasks-exception-filtering-add.PNG" alt="Add Filter Pattern"></p>
    <p>There are some rules to follow when creating your own pattern.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your pattern can only contain a '*' at the end </li>
      <li>Your pattern must be fully qualified, E.g. <em>a.b.c.MyClass</em> </li>
      <li>Your pattern cannot have spaces in it </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>a.b.c*</em> - would match everything in the package a.b.c</li>
      <li><em>a.b.c.My* - </em> would match anything in the a.b.c package that started with 'My' </li>
      <li><em>My*</em> - would match anything in the default package that started with 'My' </li>
    </ul>
