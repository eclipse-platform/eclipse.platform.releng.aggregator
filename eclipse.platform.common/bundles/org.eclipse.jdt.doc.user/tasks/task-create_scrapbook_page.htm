      Creating a Java Scrapbook Page
    </h1>
    <p>
      The scrapbook allows Java expressions, to be run, inspected, and displayed under the control of the debugger. Breakpoints and exceptions
      behave as they do in a regular debug
      session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code is edited on a scrapbook page.&nbsp; A VM is launched for each scrapbook page in which expressions are being evaluated. The first time an expression is evaluated in a scrapbook page after it is opened, a VM is
      launched. The VM for a page will remain active until the page is closed, terminated explicitly (in the debugger or via the <strong>Stop the Evaluation</strong> button in the
      editor toolbar), or when a <em>System.exit()</em> is evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to open the
