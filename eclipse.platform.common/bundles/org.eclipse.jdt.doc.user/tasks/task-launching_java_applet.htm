    <h1>
      Launching a Java Applet
    </h1>
    <p>If your Java program is structured as an applet, you can use the <strong> Java
    Applet </strong>launch configuration.&nbsp; This launch configuration uses information
    derived from the workbench preferences and your program's Java project to launch the program.
    </p>
    
<ol>
  <li> In the <strong>Package Explorer</strong>, select the Java compilation unit 
    or class file containing the applet you want to launch. </li>
  <li>Press the <strong>Run</strong> [ <img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/etool16/run_exc.svg" width="16" height="16" alt="The Run button"> 
    ] button in the workbench toolbar or select <strong>Run &gt; Run</strong> 
    from the workbench menu. Alternatively, select <strong>Run As &gt; Java Applet</strong> 
    from the <strong>Package Explorer</strong> pop-up menu, select <strong>Run 
    &gt; Run As &gt; Java Applet </strong>in the workbench menu bar, or select 
    <strong>Run As &gt; Java Applet </strong>in the drop-down menu on the <strong>Run</strong> 
    tool bar button.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Your program is now launched. </li>
</ol>
    <p>You can also launch a Java applet by selecting a project instead of the
    compilation unit or class file.&nbsp; You will be prompted to select a class
    from those classes that extend Applet.&nbsp; (If only one applet class is
        found in the project, that class is launched as if you selected it.)</p>
