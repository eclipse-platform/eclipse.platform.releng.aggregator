The Hello World view</H2>

<P >Now that we've created a project, package, and view class for our plug-in, we're ready to study some code.&nbsp; Here is everything you need in
your <b>HelloWorldView</b>.&nbsp; Copy the contents below into the
class you created, replacing the auto-generated content.&nbsp;</P>
<pre>
   package com.example.helloworld;

   import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite;
   import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label;
   import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
   import org.eclipse.ui.part.ViewPart;

   public class HelloWorldView extends ViewPart {
      Label label;
      public HelloWorldView() {
      }
      public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
         label = new Label(parent, SWT.WRAP);
         label.setText(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
      }
      public void setFocus() {
         // set focus to my widget.  For a label, this doesn't
         // make much sense, but for more complex sets of widgets
         // you would decide which one gets the focus.
      }
   }
</pre>
<P >
The view part creates the widgets that will represent it in the <b> createPartControl</b> method. In this example, we create an SWT label and set the &quot;Hello World&quot; text into it.  This
is about the simplest view that can be created.</P>
