Managed forms</H1>
<p align="left">Managed forms are wrappers that add life cycle management and 
notification to form members. Managed form is not a form by itself. It <i>has</i> 
a form and accepts registration of <code>IFormPart</code> element. For each
<code>IFormPart</code>, it manages events like dirty state, saving, commit, 
focus, selection changes etc. In order to reach to the wrapped form widget, call 
the '<code>getForm()'</code> method.</p>
<p align="left">There is a similarity between managed forms and JFace viewers - 
the relationship between a form and a managed form is similar to the one between 
a <code>Table</code> widget and <code>TableViewer</code> in JFace, for example.</p>
<p align="left">Not every control on the form needs to be a form part. It is 
better to group a number of controls and implement <code>IFormPart</code> 
interface for the group. Section is a natural group and Eclipse Form provides
<code>SectionPart</code> implementation. It implements the interface and 
contains a <code>Section</code> instance (either created outside and passed into 
the constructor, or created in the part itself).</p>
