TableWrapLayout</H1>
<p align="left">TableWrapLayout is a grid-based layout very similar to SWT's versatile 
 GridLayout. It differs from GridLayout in that it uses a layout algorithm that 
works more like HTML tables. It tries to respect the provided client area width 
and grows vertically to compensate. </p>
<p align="left">There are many similarities between GridLayout and 
TableWrapLayout. Both organize children in grids. Both have layout data that 
instructs the layout how to treat each control. Both can accept hints on which 
control should grab excess space, etc.</p>
<p align="left">However, they fundamentally differ in the approach to the 
layout. <code>TableWrapLayout</code> starts with columns. It computes minimal, 
preferred and maximum widths of each column and uses this information to assign 
excess space. It also tries to be fair when dividing space across columns so 
that there is no excess wrapping of some controls.</p>
<p align="left">It is possible to mix <code>GridLayout</code> and <code>
TableWrapLayout</code> but the branch where <code>GridLayout</code> is used is 
the one where wrapping stops. This is quite acceptable if you don't want it to 
wrap (if the composite contains controls that cannot wrap anyway, like text, 
buttons, trees etc.). However, you should have an unbroken path of TableWrapLayouts 
from the form body to each text control that needs to wrap.</p>
