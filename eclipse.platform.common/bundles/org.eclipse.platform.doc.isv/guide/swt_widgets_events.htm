<H3>Events</H3>

<P>Once we create a display and some widgets, and start up the application's
message loop, where does the real work happen? It happens every time an event is
read from the queue and dispatched to a widget. Most of the application logic is
implemented as responses to user events.</P>

<P>The basic pattern is that you add a listener to some widget that you have
created, and when the appropriate event occurs the listener code will be
executed. This simple example is adapted from
<strong>org.eclipse.swt.examples.helloworld.HelloWorld3</strong>:</P>

<pre>
   Display display = new Display ();
   Shell shell = new Shell (display);
   Label label = new Label (shell, SWT.CENTER);
   ...
   shell.addControlListener (new ControlAdapter () {
      public void controlResized (ControlEvent e) {
         label.setBounds (shell.getClientArea ());
      }
   });
</pre>

<P>For each type of listener, there is an interface that defines the listener
(<em>Xyz</em><strong>Listener</strong>), a class that provides event information
(<em>Xyz</em><strong>Event</strong>), and an API method to add the listener
(<strong>add</strong><em>Xyz</em><strong>Listener</strong>).  If there is more
than one method defined in the listener interface then there is an adapter
(<em>Xyz</em><strong>Adapter</strong>) that implements the listener interface
and provides empty methods.   All of the events, listeners,
and adapters are defined in the package
<strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/events/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.swt.events</a></strong>.</P>

<P>The following tables summarize the events that are available and the widgets
that support each event.  Events can be split into two general categories:
high level events which represent a logical operation on a control, and low
level events which describe more specific user interactions.  High level events
may be represented by multiple low level events which may differ per
platform.  Low level events should generally only be used for custom widget
implementations.</P>

<H4>Untyped events</H4>
<P>In addition to the typed event system described above, SWT supports a low level,
untyped widget event mechanism.  The untyped mechanism relies on a constant to 
identify the event type and defines a generic listener that is supplied with 
this constant. This allows the listener to implement a &quot;case style&quot; listener.
In the following snippet, we define a generic event handler and add several listeners to a shell.</P>

<pre>
   Shell shell = new Shell ();
   Listener listener = new Listener () {
      public void handleEvent (Event e) {
         switch (e.type) {
            case SWT.Resize:
               System.out.println (&quot;Resize received&quot;);
               break;
            case SWT.Paint:
               System.out.println (&quot;Paint received&quot;);
               break;
            default:
               System.out.println (&quot;Unknown event received&quot;);
         }
      }
   };
   shell.addListener (SWT.Resize, listener);
   shell.addListener (SWT.Paint, listener);
</pre>
