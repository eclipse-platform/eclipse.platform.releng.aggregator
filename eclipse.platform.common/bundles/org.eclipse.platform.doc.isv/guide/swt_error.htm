<H2>Error handling</H2>

<P>SWT can trigger three types of exceptions:
<strong>IllegalArgumentException</strong>,
<strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWTException.html">SWTException</a></strong>, and
<strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWTError.html">SWTError</a></strong>.
Applications should not have to catch any other kind of exception or error
when calling SWT.</P>

<blockquote><em>Note: If any other exception besides these three is thrown
from SWT, it should be considered a bug in the SWT implementation.</em></blockquote>

<P>Where possible, exceptions are triggered consistently across platforms.
However, some errors are specific to an SWT implementation on a particular
platform.</P>


<H3>IllegalArgumentException</H3>

<P>The arguments passed in SWT API methods are checked for appropriate state
and range before any other work is done. An <strong>IllegalArgumentException</strong>
will be thrown when it is determined that an argument is invalid.</P>

<P>Code that causes an <strong>IllegalArgumentException</strong> on one platform 
will cause the same exception on a different platform.</P>


<H3>SWTException</H3>

<P><strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWTException.html">SWTException</a></strong>
is thrown when a recoverable error occurs internally in SWT. The error code and
message text provide a further description of the problem.</P>

<P>SWT remains in a known stable state after throwing the exception.
For example, this exception is thrown when an SWT call is made from a non-UI
thread.</P>


<H3>SWTError</H3>

<P><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWTError.html"><strong>SWTError</strong></a>
is thrown when an unrecoverable error occurs inside SWT.</P>

<P>SWT will throw this error when an underlying platform call fails, leaving
SWT in an unknown state, or when SWT is known to have an unrecoverable error,
such as running out of platform graphics resources.</P>

<P>Once an SWT error has occurred, there is little that an application can do
to correct the problem. These errors should not be encountered during normal
course of operation in an application, but high reliability applications
should still catch and report the errors.</P>
