<h2>Content Types</h2>
<p>The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.core.runtime.content</a></b> 
  package provides support for detecting the content type for data streams. Content 
  types are used by several content-sensitive features of Eclipse, such as automatic 
  encoding determination, editor selection, and menu contributions. A central 
  content registry allows plug-ins to request content type detection and to find 
  out what content types are available and how they related to each other. The 
  content type registry is extensible so plug-ins can contribute new content type 
  definitions.</p>
