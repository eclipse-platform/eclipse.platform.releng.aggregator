<h2>Product Extensions</h2>
<p>An <b>extension</b> is a set of Eclipse features and plug-ins that are
designed to extend the functionality of already-installed Eclipse based
products.&nbsp; Extensions are installed separately, but used only in
conjunction with other Eclipse based products.&nbsp; This means that an extension does not
need to install a JRE, the Eclipse platform, or a primary feature.&nbsp; The
recommended directory structure for extensions allows a single installation to be
used with multiple Eclipse based products.</p>
<p>The following directory structure shows how an extension for a hypothetical
product, <b>betterwebs</b>, could be used to extend the functionality of the <b>acmeweb</b>
product.</p>
<pre>betterwebs/
	eclipse/			<i>(directory for installed Eclipse files)</i>
		.eclipseextension	(marker file)
		features/		<i>(installed features)</i>
			com.example.betterwebs.betterfeature_1.0.0/
				feature.xml
		plugins/
			com.example.betterwebs.betterfeature_1.0.0/
				plugin.xml
				about.html
			com.example.betterwebs.betterwebsupport_1.0.0/
</pre>

<p>The relationship between an extension and the product that it is designed to
enhance is set up in the <b>links</b> directory of the original product.&nbsp;
Recall the following directory in the acmeweb product:</p>
<pre>acmeweb/
	...
	eclipse/		<i>(directory for installed Eclipse files)</i>
		...
		jre/
		features/	<i>(installed features)</i>
			...
		plugins/
			...
<b>		links/
</b>			com.example.betterwebs.betterfeature.link</pre>

<p>When an extension is installed, it creates a link file in the <b>links</b>
directory of any product that it is intending to extend.&nbsp; This link file
makes the original product aware of the existence of the extension.</p>

<h3>Installing and Uninstalling Extensions</h3>

<p>The install process for extensions is similar to that for products except for
the following differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine which already-installed product is to be extended (by asking the
    user or searching the computer for the appropriate marker file)</li>
  <li>Create an <b>.eclipseextension</b> marker file (instead of an <b>.eclipseproduct</b>
    marker file).&nbsp; The format and content are similar to the product
    markers.</li>
  <li>Create a link file for the extension and write it into the <b>links</b>
    directory of the associated product.&nbsp; The link file has the same name
    as the extension's feature directory without the version suffix.&nbsp; The
    link file is a <b>java.util.Properties </b>format file which defines the path
    to the installed extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The uninstall process for extensions is similar to that for products except
that the uninstall must remove the link file from any products where it added
one. </p>
<p>Additional information on installing extensions can be found in <a href="../reference/misc/eclipse-install.html">How
to write an Eclipse installer</a>.</p>
