<h2>Infopops</h2>

<p>An infopop is a small window associated with a
particular SWT widget in a plug-in's user interface.&nbsp; It displays
context-sensitive help and links to related help topics for the widget.&nbsp;It
is activated when the user puts focus on the widget and presses the <code>F1</code>
key (<code>Ctrl+F1</code> on GTK, and <code>Help</code> key on Carbon).</p>
<p>Since Eclipse 3.1, the preferred way to show the context help is in the help 
window. However, it is still possible to configure context help presentation to 
use infopops in the Help preferences. For example, here is an infopop that has been defined on 
the General/Search page: </p>
<p class="center">
<img src="images/infopops.png" alt="Image showing an infopop">
</p>

<p>Since Eclipse 3.1, infopops have a link to show the currently displayed 
context help in the new Help view.</p>
