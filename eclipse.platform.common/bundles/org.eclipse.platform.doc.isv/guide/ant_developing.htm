<h2>
Developing Ant Tasks and Types Within Eclipse</h2>
<p>
  Ant tasks and types must be loaded by an Ant classloader instead of a plug-in
  classloader. This can cause problems when developing and testing new tasks and types
  to be run in the same VM as Eclipse. To avoid these issues, it is necessary
  to store the tasks and types in a location that is not visible to any plug-in
  classloader.</p>
<p>
  The following guidelines should be followed when developing and 
  debugging new tasks and types to be run within the same VM as Eclipse.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Contributed Ant tasks or types should be defined in their own source folder 
    within a plug-in (i.e. separate from the source folders containing regular 
    plug-in classes)</li>
  <li>Each source folder containing the Ant tasks and types should have its own 
    output location that does not overlap with the output location of the regular 
    plug-in classes.</li>
  <li>When testing/debugging the new Ant tasks or types using PDE Launch,
  additional configuration is required:
  <ul>
  <li>the project contributing
    the Ant tasks or types must be configured to <b>exclude</b> the output folders 
    containing the Ant tasks and types. Use the <b>Properties</b> dialog for the project to
    correctly configure the <b>Plug-in Development &gt; Runtime Classpath</b> by removing the Ant output 
    directories from the plug-ins classpath.</li>
  <li>The JAR file containing the Ant tasks and types and specified
  in the org.eclipse.ant.core.extraClasspathEntries extension,
  must be built manually, or using an external tool builder.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <code>org.eclipse.ant.core</code> plugin can be used as an example of how to set up a plugin that contributes tasks within Eclipse. 
 For development and testing of this plugin within Eclipse, an external tool builder
 explictly generates the tasks JAR when triggered on specific resource changes.
