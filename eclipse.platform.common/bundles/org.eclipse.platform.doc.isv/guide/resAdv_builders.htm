Incremental project builders</H2>
<P >
An <b>incremental project builder</b> is an object that manipulates the resources in a project in
a particular way.  Incremental project builders are often used to apply a
transformation on a resource to produce a resource or artifact of another kind.
Resources created by a builder are typically marked as <a href="resAdv_derived.htm">derived resources</a>.
</P>
<p>Plug-ins contribute incremental project builders to the platform in order to implement specialized resource 
transformations. For example, the Java development tools (JDT)define an incremental project builder that compiles
a Java source file into a class file any time a file is added or modified in a Java project.  It also
keeps track of dependent files and recompiles them when necessary.
</p>
<p>From an API point of view, the platform defines two basic types of builds:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b> full build </b> performs a build from scratch. It treats all resources in a project
as if they have never been seen by the builder.</li>
<li>An <b> incremental build</b> uses a &quot;last build state,&quot; maintained internally by the builder,
to do an optimized build based on the changes in the project since the last build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incremental builds are seeded with a resource change delta. The delta reflects the net effect of all resource 
changes since the builder last built the project.  This delta is similar to the one used inside resource change events.
</p>
<p>Projects can be periodically <b>cleaned</b> by the user in order to force a rebuild of a complete project
the next time an incremental build is performed on that project.  Cleaning a project removes build information
such as problem markers and class files.
</p>
<p>Projects support multiple <a href="resAdv_buildconfigs.htm">build configurations</a> which allow Incremental 
Project Builders to build a project in more than one way while providing a resource delta for each build configuration.
</p>
<p>Builders are best understood by example. The JDT Java compiler is driven by a Java incremental project builder 
which recompiles the files in a project that are affected by changes. When a full build is triggered, (or an incremental
build after a clean), all of the <b> .java</b> files in the project are compiled. Any compile problems encountered 
are added as problem markers on the affected <b> .java</b> files. When an incremental build is triggered, the builder 
selectively recompiles the added, changed, or otherwise affected <b>.java</b> files that are described in the 
resource delta and updates the problem markers as necessary. Any <b>.class</b> files or markers that are no 
longer appropriate are removed.
</p>
<p>Incremental building has obvious performance benefits for projects with hundreds or thousands of resources, 
most of which are unchanging at any given point in time.
</p>
<P >
The technical challenge for incremental building is to determine exactly what needs to be rebuilt. For example, the
internal state maintained by the Java builder includes things like a dependency
graph and a list of compilation problems reported.  This information is used during an incremental build to 
identify which classes need to be recompiled in response to a change in a Java resource. </P>
<P >
Although the basic structure for building is defined in the platform, the real work is done in the builder
code.  Patterns for implementing complex incremental builders are beyond the scope of this discussion, since the 
implementation is dependent on the specific builder design. </P>

<H3>Invoking a build</H3>
<p>A builder can be invoked explicitly in one of the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>IProject.build()</b> runs the build processing on the receiving project according to the build
method's arguments.</li>
<li><b>IWorkspace.build()</b> runs the build processing on all open projects in the workspace.</li>
</ul>
<P >
In practice, the workbench user triggers a build by selecting corresponding commands in the resource 
navigator menu.</P>
<P >
Incremental project builders are also invoked implicitly by the platform during an auto-build.
If enabled, auto-builds run whenever the workspace is changed.</P>
<H3>
Defining an incremental project builder</H3>
<P >
The <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_builders.html"> <b> org.eclipse.core.resources.builders</b></a> extension point is used to contribute an
incremental project builder to the platform. The following markup shows how the hypothetical plug-in
<b> com.example.builders</b> could contribute an incremental project builder.</P>
<pre>
   &lt;extension
      id=&quot;mybuilder&quot; name=&quot;My Sample Builder&quot; point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.builders&quot;&gt;
      &lt;builder
         &lt;run 
            <b>class=&quot;com.example.builders.BuilderExample&quot;</b>&gt;
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;optimize&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;parameter name=&quot;comment&quot; value=&quot;Builder comment&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;/run&gt;
      &lt;/builder&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
<P >
The <b> class</b> identified in the extension point must extend the platform class 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IncrementalProjectBuilder.html">IncrementalProjectBuilder</a></b>. </P>
<pre>
   public class BuilderExample extends IncrementalProjectBuilder {
      IProject[] build(int kind, Map args, IProgressMonitor monitor)
            throws CoreException {
         // add your build logic here
         return null;
      }
      protected void startupOnInitialize() {
         // add builder init logic here
      }
      protected void clean(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
         // add builder clean logic here
      }
   }
</pre>
<P >
Build processing begins with the <b> build()</b> method, which includes information about the kind of build that 
has been requested.  The build is one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>FULL_BUILD</b> indicates that all resources in the project should be built. No delta is available.</li>
<li><b>INCREMENTAL_BUILD</b> indicates that the build is incremental.</li>
<li><b>AUTO_BUILD</b> indicates that an incremental build is being triggered automatically because a
resource has changed and the autobuild feature is on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an incremental build or workspace auto-build have been requested, a resource delta is provided to describe the changes in the 
resources since the last build.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If no delta is available, the build kind will
always be FULL_BUILD. See <a href="#advanced_build_kinds">Advanced Build Kinds</a> for more on build kinds.</p>

<p>The following snippet further refines the
<b> build() </b> method.
</P>
<pre>   protected IProject[] build(int kind, Map args, IProgressMonitor monitor
         throws CoreException {
      if (kind == IncrementalProjectBuilder.FULL_BUILD) {
         fullBuild(monitor);
      } else {
         IResourceDelta delta = getDelta(getProject());
         if (delta == null) {
            fullBuild(monitor);
         } else {
            incrementalBuild(delta, monitor);
         }
      }
      return null;
   }
</pre>

<P>It sometimes happens that when building project &quot;X,&quot; a builder
needs information about changes in some other project &quot;Y.&quot;&nbsp; (For
example, if a Java class in X implements an interface provided in Y.)&nbsp;
While building X, a delta for Y is available by calling <b>getDelta(Y)</b>.&nbsp;
To ensure that the platform can provide such deltas, X's builder must have
declared the dependency between X and Y by returning an array containing Y from
a previous <b>build()</b> call.&nbsp; If a builder has no dependencies, it can simply return null.
See <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IncrementalProjectBuilder.html">IncrementalProjectBuilder</a></b>
for further information.</P>

<H4>
Full build</H4>
<P >
The logic required to process a full build request is specific to the plug-in. It may involve visiting every 
resource in the project or even examining other projects if there are dependencies between projects.
The following snippet suggests how a full build might be implemented.</P>
<pre>
   protected void fullBuild(final IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException {
      try {
         getProject().accept(new MyBuildVisitor());
      } catch (CoreException e) { }
   }
</pre>
<P >
The build visitor would perform the build for the specific resource (and answer true to continue visiting all 
child resources).</P>
<pre>
   class MyBuildVisitor implements IResourceVisitor {
      public boolean visit(IResource res) {
         //build the specified resource.
         //return true to continue visiting children.
         return true;
      }
   }
</pre>
<P >
The visit process continues until the full resource tree has been traveled.</P>

<H4>
Incremental build</H4>
<P >
When performing an incremental build, the builder works with a resource change delta instead of a complete
resource tree.</P>
<pre>
   protected void incrementalBuild(IResourceDelta delta, 
         IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException {
      // the visitor does the work.
      delta.accept(new MyBuildDeltaVisitor());
   }
</pre>
<P >
The visit process continues until the complete resource delta tree has been traveled. The specific nature of changes
is similar to that described in
<a HREF="resAdv_events.htm#resAdv_events_listener" CLASS="XRef">Implementing a resource change listener</a>.&nbsp;
One important difference is that with incremental project builders, you are working with a resource delta based 
on a particular project, not the entire workspace.</P>

<H4>
Cleaning before a build</H4>
<P>
The workbench allows users to <b>clean</b> a project or set of projects before initiating a build.  This feature
allows the user to force a rebuild from scratch on only certain projects.  Builders should implement 
this method to clean up any problem markers and <a href="resAdv_derived.htm">derived resources</a> in the project.
</P>

<h4>Build Locking</h4>

<p>
By default, builders run with the <a href="resAdv_batching.htm">Workspace Root scheduling rule</a>.  This prevents other threads from modifying the Eclipse
workspace while the build is in progress.  Long running builders, or builders which do not care about concurrent changes
in parts of the resource tree, may wish to allow modification while the build is in progress.
A builder may relax the scheduling rule its run with by overriding the #getRule method:
</p>

<pre>
  public ISchedulingRule <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IncrementalProjectBuilder.html#getRule(int,%20java.util.Map)">getRule</a>(int kind, Map&lt;String,String&gt; args) {
    // Allow any resource to be modified concurrently with this buidler's invocation.
    return null;
  }
</pre>

<h4>Discovering What's Being Built</h4>

It's sometimes useful for a builder to discover why its being built.  Builders have access to a build context by calling
<pre>
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IBuildContext.html">IBuildContext</a> buildContext = <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IncrementalProjectBuilder.html#getContext()">getContext</a>();
</pre>
When building a project and its references, projects may be implicitly built if they are reachable 
in the reference graph of the top-level project the user requested built.
With this API a builder can discover which <a href="resAdv_buildconfigs.htm">build configurations</a> have been built before it 
(<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IBuildContext.html#getAllReferencedBuildConfigs()">IBuildContext#getAllReferencedBuildConfigs()</a>), will be built after 
it (<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IBuildContext.html#getAllReferencingBuildConfigs()">IBuildContext#getAllReferencingBuildConfigs()</a>), as well as 
which build configurations the user asked to be built (<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IBuildContext.html#getRequestedConfigs()">IBuildContext#getRequestedConfigs()</a>).  

<H3>
Associating an incremental project builder with a project</H3>
<P >
To make a builder available for a given project, it must be included in the build spec for the project. 
A project's build spec is a list of commands to run, in sequence, when the project is built. Each command 
names a single incremental project builder. </P>
<P>
<b>NOTE:</b> The builder name in a build command is the fully qualified id
of the builder extension. The fully qualified id of an extension is created by combining
the plug-in id with the simple extension id in the plugin.xml file. For example, a builder with simple extension
id &quot;mybuilder&quot; in the plug-in &quot;com.example.builders&quot; would have the
name &quot;com.example.builders.mybuilder&quot;</p>
<P >
The following snippet adds a new builder as the first builder in the existing list of builders.</P>
<pre>
   final String BUILDER_ID = "com.example.builders.mybuilder";
   IProjectDescription desc = project.getDescription();
   ICommand[] commands = desc.getBuildSpec();
   boolean found = false;

   for (int i = 0; i &lt; commands.length; ++i) {
      if (commands[i].getBuilderName().equals(BUILDER_ID)) {
         found = true;
         break;
      }
   }
   if (!found) { 
      //add builder to project
      ICommand command = desc.newCommand();
      command.setBuilderName(BUILDER_ID);
      ICommand[] newCommands = new ICommand[commands.length + 1];

      // Add it before other builders.
      System.arraycopy(commands, 0, newCommands, 1, commands.length);
      newCommands[0] = command;
      desc.setBuildSpec(newCommands);
      project.setDescription(desc, null);
   }
</pre>
<P >
Configuring a project's builder is done just once, usually as the project is being created.
A common way to associate a builder with a project is by configuring a <a href="resAdv_natures.htm">project nature</a>.
</P>
<H3><a id="advanced_build_kinds">Advanced Build Kinds</a></H3>

<h4>Triggers vs. Kinds</h4>
<p>When a build is invoked on an IProject or IWorkspace, we call the passed in build kind the build <i>trigger</i>.
This trigger is usually passed through to the IncrementalProjectBuilder as the build <i>kind</i> argument when IncrementalProjectBuilder#build
is invoked.</p> 
<p>The major exception to this is where no delta exists. In this case the build <i>trigger</i> is always promoted to <b>FULL_BUILD</b>.</p>

The mapping between triggers and kinds looks like: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Trigger</th>
<th>Kind</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FULL_BUILD</td>
<td>FULL_BUILD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INCREMENTAL_BUILD</td>
<td>INCREMENTAL_BUILD or FULL_BUILD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AUTO_BUILD</td>
<td>AUTO_BUILD or FULL_BUILD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CLEAN_BUILD</td>
<td>IncrementalProjectBuilder#clean(...)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Ignoring Build Kinds</h4>

<p>
The platform provides API for configuring which build <i>kind</i>s a builder responds to.  If the builder is marked
as 'isConfigurable' in its <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_builders.html">extension point</a> it can be configured at runtime to respond to, or ignore, certain build <i>triggers</i>.
</p>

For example a long running builder which doesn't want to be called during workspace AUTO_BUILD, can use:
<pre>
  <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ICommand.html">ICommand</a>#setBuilding(AUTO_BUILD, false);
</pre>

It is important to note that: 
<ul>
<li>
if INCREMENTAL_BUILD (or AUTO_BUILD) is promoted to FULL_BUILD, a builder that responds to INCREMENTAL_BUILD (or AUTO_BUILD) will be called,
</li><li>
if INCREMENTAL_BUILD is promoted to FULL_BUILD, a builder that responds to FULL_BUILD will be called,
</li><li>
if AUTO_BUILD is promoted to FULL_BUILD, <strong>only</strong> builders that respond to AUTO_BUILD will be called. 
This is to allow long running builders to ignore AUTO_BUILD requests completely.
</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/ICommand.html">ICommand</a> for more information.</p>
