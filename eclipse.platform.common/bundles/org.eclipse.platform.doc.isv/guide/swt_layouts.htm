<H2>Layouts</H2>

<P>Often the best way to handle simple widget positioning is in a resize event
listener.  However, there are common patterns used by applications when placing
widgets.  These patterns can be structured as configurable layout algorithms
that can be reused by many different applications.</P>

<P>SWT defines <em>layouts</em> that provide general purpose positioning and
sizing of child widgets in a composite.  Layouts are subclasses of the abstract
class <strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Layout.html">Layout</a></strong>.
The SWT standard layouts can be found in the
<strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.swt.layout</a></strong>
package.</P>

<P>There are some general definitions used when resizing and positioning
widgets:</P>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>location</em> of a widget is its x,y coordinate location within
    its parent widget.</li>
  <li>The <em>preferred size</em> of a widget is the minimum size needed to
    show its content. This is computed differently for each kind of widget.</li>
  <li>The <em>clientArea</em> is the area in which a child can be placed without
    being clipped.</li>
  <li>The <em>trim</em> is the distance between a widget's client area and its
    actual border.  Trim is occupied by the widget's borders or extra space
    at its edge.  The size and appearance of the trim is widget and platform
    dependent.</li>
</ul>

<P>These concepts are relevant for applications regardless of whether a layout
is used. You can think of a layout as a convenient way to package resize
functionality for reuse.</P>

<P>Some additional concepts are introduced by layouts:</P>

<ul>
  <li>Some layouts support <em>spacing</em> between widgets in the layout.</li>
  <li>Some layouts support a <em>margin</em> between the edge of the layout and
    the widget adjacent to the edge.</li>
</ul>

<P>See <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Understanding-Layouts/Understanding-Layouts.htm">Understanding
layouts in SWT</a> for further discussion and pictures demonstrating these concepts.</P>

<P>The following code snippet shows the simple case of an application using a
resize callback to size a label to the size of its parent shell:</P>

<pre>
   Display display = new Display ();
   Shell shell = new Shell (display);
   Label label = new Label (shell, SWT.CENTER);
   shell.addControlListener (new ControlAdapter () {
      public void controlResized (ControlEvent e) {
         label.setBounds (shell.getClientArea ());
      }
   });
</pre>

<P>The next snippet uses a layout to achieve the same effect:</P>

<pre>
   Display display = new Display ();
   Shell shell = new Shell (display);
   Label label = new Label (shell, SWT.CENTER);
   shell.setLayout (new FillLayout ());
</pre>

<P>Even for this simple example, using a layout reduces the application code.
For more complex layouts, the simplification is much greater.</P>

<p>The following table summarizes the standard layouts provided by SWT.</p>

<table style="width:60%">
<colgroup>
    <col style="width:34%">
    <col style="width:66%">
</colgroup>
<tr>
<th><div CLASS="CellHeading">Layout</div></th>
<th><div CLASS="CellHeading">Purpose</div></th>
</tr>

<TR>
<td><strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/FillLayout.html">FillLayout</a></strong></td>
<td>Lays out controls in a single row or column, forcing them to be the same
size.</td>
</tr>
<TR>
<td><strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/FormLayout.html">FormLayout</a></strong></td>
<td>Positions the children by using FormAttachments to optionally configure the
left, top, right and bottom edges of each child.</td>
</tr>

<TR>
<td><strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/GridLayout.html">GridLayout</a></strong></td>
<td>Positions the children by rows and columns.</td>
</tr>

<TR>
<td><strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/RowLayout.html">RowLayout</a></strong></td>
<td>Places the children either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</td>
