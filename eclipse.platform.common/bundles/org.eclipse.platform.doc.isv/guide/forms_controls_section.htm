Expandable composite and Section controls</H1>
<p><code>ExpandableComposite</code> acts similar to <code>Group</code> control 
with the ability to collapse a portion of a page a toggle control:</p>
<div>
	<pre>	ExpandableComposite ec = toolkit.createExpandableComposite(form.getBody(), 
					ExpandableComposite.TREE_NODE|
					ExpandableComposite.CLIENT_INDENT);
	ec.setText(&quot;Expandable Composite title&quot;);
	String ctext = &quot;We will now create a somewhat long text so that &quot;+
	&quot;we can use it as content for the expandable composite. &quot;+
	&quot;Expandable composite is used to hide or show the text using the &quot;+
	&quot;toggle control&quot;;
	Label client = toolkit.createLabel(ec, ctext, SWT.WRAP);
	ec.setClient(client);
	ec.addExpansionListener(new ExpansionAdapter() {
		public void expansionStateChanged(ExpansionEvent e) {
			form.reflow(true);
		}
	});</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>ExpandableComposite</code> control accepts a number of styles that 
affect its appearance and behavior. Style <code>TREE_NODE</code> will create the 
toggle control used in a tree widget for expanding and collapsing nodes, while
<code>TWISTIE</code> will create a triangle-style toggle. Using <code>EXPANDED</code> 
will create the control in the initial expanded state. If style <code>COMPACT</code> 
is used, control will report width in the collapsed state enough to fit in the 
title line only (i.e. when collapsed, it will be as compact horizontally as 
possible). Finally, <code>CLIENT_INDENT</code> will indent the client to align 
with the title (otherwise, client will be aligned with the toggle control).</p>
<p>Expandable composite itself is responsible for rendering the toggle control 
and the title. The control to expand or collapse is set as a client. Note the 
requirement that the client is a direct child of the expandable composite.</p>
<p>Expandable composite fires <code>ExpansionEvent</code> objects when expansion 
state changes. Adding an expansion listener to the control is needed in order to 
reflow the form on state change. This is because expansion causes changes in 
expandable composite size, but the change will not take effect until the next 
time the parent is laid out (hence we need to force it).</p>
<p><code>Section</code> is a subclass of the expandable composite that adds 
additional capabilities. It is typically used to partition a form into a number 
of sections, each with its own title and optional description. When <code>
Section.TITLE_BAR</code> or <code>Section.SHORT_TITLE_BAR</code> styles are 
used, decoration around the title area further enhances the grouping.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>ExpandableComposite</code>, <code>Section</code> automatically 
handles reflows on expansion state change. Other interesting uses of the 
expansion state notification are lazy creation of the Section content that is 
delayed until the section is expaned.</p>
