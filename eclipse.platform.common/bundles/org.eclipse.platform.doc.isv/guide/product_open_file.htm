<h2>Associate and Open Files</h2>
<p>
An Eclipse based <b>product</b> is a stand-alone program built with the
Eclipse platform.  In many cases such a program would like to be associated with
particular file types or extensions.  For example, the Eclipse IDE  
could be configured to open all Java files.  This would allow a user 
to double click on a Java file and have it be opened in a running Eclipse
IDE instance or start a new instance of the Eclipse IDE if it was not 
previously running.  In order to support this coordination is needed 
between the Eclipse native launcher, SWT, the workbench and the RCP
application.
</p>
<p>
New command line options have been added to support this scenario:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../reference/misc/runtime-options.html#launcheropenfile">--launcher.openFile</a>
      Specifies a file to be opened.
  </li>
  <li><a href="../reference/misc/runtime-options.html#launcherdefaultaction">--launcher.defaultAction</a>
      Specifies an action to take when the launcher is started without any &quot;-&quot; arguments on 
      the command line.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The openFile argument opens the specified file in an instance of 
Eclipse.  If an instance is not already running then a new instance will be started.
</p>

<pre>  eclipse --launcher.openFile myFile.txt</pre>

<p>
A second option is needed to configure the launcher to automatically perform the open file 
request without requiring the user to always specify --launcher.openFile.  A new &quot;default action&quot; argument has been introduced to accomplish this.  This option
can go in the launcher.ini (eclipse.ini) file, the value must be &quot;openFile&quot;:
</p>

<pre>  ...
  -showsplash
  org.eclipse.platform
  --launcher.defaultAction
  openFile
  -vmargs
  -Xms256m
  -Xmx768m</pre>

<p>
This tells the launcher that if none of the command line arguments start with &quot;-&quot; then all command line arguments should be treated as if they
followed the &quot;--launcher.openFile&quot; argument.
</p>

<pre>  eclipse myFile.txt</pre>

<p>
This option was added because without registry changes, this is the kind of command line the launcher will receive on windows when you double click a file that 
is associated with eclipse, or you select files and choose &quot;Open With&quot; or &quot;Send To&quot; Eclipse.
</p>

<h3>Talking to SWT</h3>

<p>
The launcher talks to SWT through the use of a hidden window. The launcher and SWT both need to agree on 
the name of this window. This allows the launcher to find an already running eclipse and tell it to open 
the file. Any RCP application will need to ensure they get this right for things to work.
</p>
<p>
The launcher bases this on its &quot;official name&quot;. The official name can be set with the -name argument.
If -name is not set, then the official name is derived from the launcher executable, the extension is removed
and the first letter is capitalized: rcp.exe becomes Rcp.
</p>
<p>
SWT bases this on the value set with the Display.setAppName() function. Normally, this is set by the
Workbench when it creates the display and the value is the "appName" taken from the product extension point.
</p>

<h3>Listening to SWT.OpenDocument Events</h3>
<p>
The launcher communicates with SWT to inform SWT about a request to open one or more files.  SWT then
can fire the SWT.OpenDocument event.  For an RCP application to take advantage of this it must register
a listener for the SWT.OpenDocument event.  It should register this listener before calling
PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench so that the listener is in place before the workbench starts running 
the event loop.
</p>
<p>
The event loop will start running while the splash screen is still up, so events may arrive before the 
workbench is ready to actually open an editor for the file. This means that the listener should save 
the file paths it gets from the OpenDocument events so they can be opened at some later time. 
WorkbenchAdvisor.eventLoopIdle can be a good place to check for saved open file events.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example RCP application that does this.  First is the IApplication implementation:
</p>
<pre>public class Application implements IApplication {	

	public Object start(IApplicationContext context) {
		OpenDocumentEventProcessor openDocProcessor = 
			new OpenDocumentEventProcessor();

		Display display = PlatformUI.createDisplay();
		display.addListener(SWT.OpenDocument, openDocProcessor);

		try {
			int returnCode = PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(display, new 
				ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor(openDocProcessor));
			if (returnCode == PlatformUI.RETURN_RESTART) {
				return IApplication.EXIT_RESTART;
			}
			return IApplication.EXIT_OK;
		} finally {
			display.dispose();
		}
	}
	...
}</pre>

<p>
Next is an example SWT Listener that listens to the SWT.OpenDocument event:
</p>
<pre>public class OpenDocumentEventProcessor implements Listener {
	private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; filesToOpen = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(1);
	
	public void handleEvent(Event event) {
		if (event.text != null)
			filesToOpen.add(event.text);
	}

	public void openFiles() {
		if (filesToOpen.isEmpty())
			return;

		String[] filePaths = filesToOpen.toArray(
			new String[filesToOpen.size()]);
		filesToOpen.clear();
		
		for (String path : filePaths) {
			// open the file path
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>
Finally we need a WorkbenchAdvisor that will open the files durying eventLoopIdle:
</p>
<pre>public class ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor extends WorkbenchAdvisor {
	private OpenDocumentEventProcessor openDocProcessor;

	public ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor(
			OpenDocumentEventProcessor openDocProcessor) {
		this.openDocProcessor = openDocProcessor;
	}

	...

	public void eventLoopIdle(Display display) {
		openDocProcessor.openFiles();
		super.eventLoopIdle(display);
	}
}</pre>
