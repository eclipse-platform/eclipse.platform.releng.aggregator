<H2>Linked resources</H2>
<P >Earlier discussions of resources and the file system (<a href="resInt_filesystem.htm#mapping">Mapping
resources to disk locations)</a> assumed that all resources in a project are
located in the same place in the file system.&nbsp; This is generally
true.&nbsp; However, the concept of <b>linked resources</b> in the workbench is
provided so that files and folders inside a project can be stored in a file system outside of the project's location.&nbsp;
</P>
<P >Linked resources can
be located virtually anywhere in a file system.  They can reside outside the project location,
or even within another project.  There are only a few restrictions on linked
resource locations. The method 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IWorkspace.html">IWorkspace</a>.validateLinkLocation</b>
can be used to ensure that a given location is valid for creating a linked resource.
</P>
<P>
Linked resources are created using the method 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IFolder.html">IFolder</a>.createLink</b> or
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IFile.html">IFile</a>.createLink</b>.  
To determine programmatically whether a given resource is a linked resource, you
can use the method
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a>.isLinked</b>.
Note that this method will only return <code>true</code> for linked resources, not for children 
of linked resources.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these special methods for creating linked resources and
finding out if a resource is linked, you can use normal workspace API when manipulating linked
resources.  In most respects, linked resources act exactly like any other resource in
the workspace.  However, some restrictions apply when moving, copying, or
deleting linked resources.&nbsp; See <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a></b>
and its sub-classes for information on individual operations and their limitations.
</P>
<h3>Path Variables</h3>
<P>
  Path variables can be used
when specifying the location of linked resources.&nbsp; A path variable is a simple (String -&gt;
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/IPath.html">IPath</a></b>) 
or (String -&gt; <b>URI</b>) mapping that 
defines a shortcut for a location in a file system.&nbsp; Variables can ease
the management of linked resources by reducing the number of places where
hard-coded, absolute file system paths are used.</p><P>Path variables
streamline the management of linked resources for users in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows a single reference to the absolute path when defining several linked resources under a common
  root</li>
<li>Allows the location of several resources to be redefined by changing a
  single variable</li>
<li>Allows users to share projects containing linked resources without updating
  the paths of each resource (since the absolute path can vary from one machine
  to another.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last item in this list deserves a bit of explanation.  When a user creates a
linked resource in a project, a description of the linked resource is added to the
project description file (&quot;.project&quot;) in the project's location. By
using a path variable, users can share a project (by copying the project's
content or by using a repository), and redefine the variable to suit each
individual workstation.&nbsp; For example, one user might store external resources under c:\temp on
one system,
while another user using Unix might store the same resources in /home/username/tmp.&nbsp;
Defining a path variable on each workspace (<code>TEMP=c:\temp</code> and <code>TEMP=/home/userb/tmp)</code>
 allows users to work around this difference and share the projects with linked
resources as is.</p>
<p><b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IPathVariableManager.html">IPathVariableManager</a></b>
 defines the API for creating, manipulating, and resolving path variables. It also provides methods for validating variable names and values before
creating them, and for installing a listener to be notified when path variable definitions
change.  You can obtain an instance of this class using
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IWorkspace.html">IWorkspace</a>.getPathVariableManager</b>.
See the code examples at the end of this section for more detail.</p>
<p>
The method 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a>.getRawLocationURI</b>
can be used to find out the unresolved location of a linked resource. That is,
to get the actual path variable name instead of resolving it to its value.&nbsp;
If a resource location is not defined with a path variable, the <b>getRawLocationURI</b>
method acts exactly like the <b>getLocationURI</b> method.
</p>
<h3>Broken Links</h3>
<p>
Clients that manipulate resources programmatically need to be aware of the possibility of
broken links.  Broken links occur when a linked resource's location does not
exist, or is specified relative to an undefined path variable. The following
special cases apply when using <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a></b>
protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>copy</b> and <b>move</b> methods will fail when called on broken links.</li>
<li>Calling <b>refreshLocal</b> on a broken link will not cause the resource to be removed
from the workspace, as it does for normal resources that are missing from the file system.</li>
<li>The method <b>getLocation</b> will return <code>null</code> for linked resources
whose locations are relative to undefined path variables.</li>
<li>You can still use <b>delete</b> to remove broken links from the workspace.</li>
</ul>
<H3>Compatibility with installed plug-ins</H3>
<p>
Some plug-ins may not be able to handle linked resources, so there are a number
of mechanisms available for disabling them.  If you are writing a plug-in that absolutely
needs all of a project's contents to be located in the project's default location, you 
can use these mechanisms to prevent users from creating linked resources where
you don't want them to appear.
</p>
<p>
The first mechanism is called the <i>project nature veto</i>.  If you define your
own <a href="resAdv_natures.htm">project nature</a>, you can specify in the nature 
definition that the nature is not compatible with linked resources.  Here is an example 
of a nature definition that 
employs the nature veto:</p>
<pre>&lt;extension
	id=&quot;myNature&quot;
	name=&quot;My Nature&quot;
	point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.natures&quot;&gt;
	&lt;runtime&gt;
		&lt;run class=&quot;com.xyz.MyNature&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/runtime&gt;
	&lt;options <b>allowLinking=&quot;false&quot;</b>/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The second mechanism for preventing linked resource creation is the <i>team hook</i>.
If you define your own repository implementation, you can make use of the <b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_teamHook.html">org.eclipse.core.resources.teamHook</a></b>
extension point to prevent the creation of linked
resources in projects that are shared with your repository type.  By default, 
repository providers do <em>not</em> allow linked resources in projects
connected to the repository.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the repository support is provided by an older plug-in
that is not aware of linked resources, you will not be able to create linked resources
in those projects.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is a preference setting that can be used to disable linked resources
for the entire workspace.  While the previous two veto mechanisms work
on a per-project basis, this preference affects all projects in the workspace.  To
set this preference programatically, use the preference <code>ResourcesPlugin.PREF_DISABLE_LINKING</code>.
Note that even when set, users or plug-ins can override this by turning the preference
off.
</p>

<H3>Linked resources in code</H3>
<P >
Let's go into some examples of using linked resources in code. We'll start by 
defining a path variable:</p>
<pre>   IWorkspace workspace = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace();
   IPathVariableManager pathMan = workspace.getPathVariableManager();
   String name = &quot;TEMP&quot;;
   IPath value = new Path(&quot;c:\\temp&quot;);
   if (pathMan.validateName(name).isOK() &amp;&amp; pathMan.validateValue(value).isOK()) {
      pathMan.setValue(name, value);
   } else {
      //invalid name or value, throw an exception or warn user
   }
</pre>
<p>Now we can create a linked resource relative to the defined path variable:</p>
<pre>   IProject project = workspace.getProject(&quot;Project&quot;);//assume this exists
   IFolder link = project.getFolder(&quot;Link&quot;);
   IPath location = new Path(&quot;TEMP/folder&quot;);
   if (workspace.validateLinkLocation(location).isOK()) {
      link.createLink(location, IResource.NONE, null);
   } else {
      //invalid location, throw an exception or warn user
   }
</pre>
<p>That's it!  You now have a linked folder in your workspace called &quot;Link&quot;
that is located at &quot;c:\temp\folder&quot;.</p>
<p>
Let's end with some code snippets on this linked resource to illustrate the behavior other
methods related to linked resources:</p>
<pre>
   link.getFullPath() ==&gt; &quot;/Project/Link&quot;
   link.getLocation() ==&gt; &quot;c:\temp\folder&quot;
   link.getRawLocation() ==&gt; &quot;TEMP/folder&quot;
   link.isLinked() ==&gt; &quot;true&quot;
   
   IFile child = link.getFile(&quot;abc.txt&quot;);
   child.create(...);
   child.getFullPath() ==&gt; &quot;/Project/Link/abc.txt&quot;
   child.getLocation() ==&gt; &quot;c:\temp\folder\abc.txt&quot;
   child.getRawLocation() ==&gt; &quot;c:\temp\folder\abc.txt&quot;
   child.isLinked() ==&gt; &quot;false&quot;
</pre>
