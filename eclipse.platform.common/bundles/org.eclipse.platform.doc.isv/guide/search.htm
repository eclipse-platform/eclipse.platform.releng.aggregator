Search support</H1>


<p>
If your plug-in defines and manipulates its own resource types, you may have
special requirements for searching a resource.&nbsp; For example, the Java IDE
plug-in implements a search engine specialized for Java files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>
The <b>search</b> plug-in allows you to add a specialized page describing your
search to the workbench search dialog.&nbsp; This allows you to obtain any
specialized information needed from the user and perform a search using your
plug-in's internal model.</p>


<p>
You should also provide a specialized class for displaying the search results.
Abstract implementations of a search result page are provided to give you a head
start.</p>


<p>
These services are contributed using search plug-in extension points.</p>
