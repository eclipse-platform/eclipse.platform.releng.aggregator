<h2>Synchronization Support</h2>
<p>Eclipse includes APIs for managing and displaying synchronization state 
  between workspace resources and resources in another location. We refer to a 
  resource outside of the workspace as a variant. Synchronizing is the act of 
  displaying the changes between resources in different locations and optionally 
  allowing the user to affect the synchronization state by performing an action. 
  The synchronize APIs are orthogonal to the RepositoryProvider APIs and can be 
  used without a repository provider. The purpose of the synchronization API is 
  to ease the task of implementing different ways of presenting the synchronization 
  state of resources. As such, the API requires a means to query the synchronization 
  state of resources but does not require a means to affect the state. The means 
  of affecting the state is left to the implementer (although the UI does provide 
  hooks for adding provider specific menu items to menus).</p>
<h3>Terminology </h3>
<p>Before the synchronization API is described, it is helpful to
present some of the terminology and concepts that apply when discussing
workspace synchronization.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Resource Variant</em>: A local resource that is mapped to a resource 
    that exists at another location can be referred to as a variant of that resource. 
    That is, the resources are usually very similar but may differ slightly (either 
    due to modifications to the local resource or changes made the remote copy 
    by other users). We take a local workspace centric view of this, referring 
    to the local copy as the resource and any remote copy as resource variants.</p>
  <p><em>Synchronize</em>: We refer to synchronize as the action of displaying 
    to the user the differences between resource variants. Synchronizing doesn't 
    affect the state of the variants, but instead provides a view to help the 
    user understand the differences between different sets of variants. It is 
    common however to allow users to affect the states of the variants (e.g. allowing 
    to check-in, or revert) while synchronizing.</p>
  <p><em>Two-way vs. Three-way Synchronization</em>: There are two basic types 
    of synchronization state determination: two-way and three-way. A two-way comparison 
    only considers the local resource and a single resource variant, referred 
    to as the remote resource variant. This type of comparison can only show the 
    differences between the two resources but cannot offer hints as to how the 
    changes interrelate. Most code repository systems support a three-way comparison 
    for synchronization state determination. This type of comparison involves 
    the local resource, a remote resource variant and a base resource variant. 
    The base resource variant represents a common ancestor for the local and remote 
    resources. This allows for more sophisticated synchronization states that 
    indicate the direction of the change.<br>

<h3>The Basics - SyncInfo</h3>
<p>
The classes in the <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/synchronize/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.team.core.synchronize</a>
are used to describe the synchronization state. The most important
class is <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/synchronize/SyncInfo.html">SyncInfo</a>
because it is the class that actually defines the synchronization
state. It can be used as follows:
</p>
<pre><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 204);">SyncInfo info = getSyncInfo(resource); // this is a simulated method of obtaining the sync info for a resource<br>int changekind = info.getKind();<br>if(info.getResourceComparator().isThreeWay()) {<br>  if((changeKind &amp; SyncInfo.DIRECTION_MASK) == SyncInfo.INCOMING) {<br>    // do something<br>  }<br>} else if(changeKind == SyncInfo.CHANGE) {<br>    // do something else<br>}</span></pre>
<p>
The SyncInfo class provides both the two-way and three-way comparison algorithms, 
a client must provide the resources and a class that can compare the resources 
(<a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/variants/IResourceVariantComparator.html">IResourceVariantComparator</a>). 
Here is an example variant comparator:
</p>
<pre style="color: rgb(68, 68, 204);">public class TimestampVariantComparator implements IResourceVariantComparator {	<br>  protected boolean compare(IResourceVariant e1, IResourceVariant e2) {<br>    if(e1.isContainer()) {<br>      if(e2.isContainer()) {<br>        return true;<br>      }<br>      return false;<br>    }<br>    if(e1 instanceof MyResourceVariant &amp;&amp; e2 instanceof MyResourceVariant) {<br>      MyResourceVariant myE1 = (MyResourceVariant)e1; <br>      MyResourceVariant myE2 = (MyResourceVariant)e2; <br>      return myE1.getTimestamp().equals(myE2.getTimestamp());<br>    }<br>    return false;<br>  }<br>  protected boolean compare(IResource e1, IResourceVariant e2) {<br>      <br>  }<br>  public boolean isThreeWay() {<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>}<br><br>SyncInfo info = new SyncInfo(resource, variant1, variant2, new TimestampComparator());<br>info.init(); // calculate the sync info</pre>
<p>This package also contains collections specifically designed to contain
SyncInfo and filters that can be applied to SyncInfo instances.
</p>
<h3>Managing the Synchronization State</h3>
<p>
As we have seen in the examples above, <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/synchronize/SyncInfo.html">SyncInfo
</a>and
<a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/variants/IResourceVariantComparator.html">IResourceVariantComparator</a>
 classes provide access to the
synchronization state of resources. But what we haven't seen yet is how
the state is managed. A <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/subscribers/Subscriber.html">Subscriber</a>
provides access to the synchronization state between the resources in
the local workspace and a set of resource variants for these resources
using either a two-way or three-way comparison, depending on the nature
of the subscriber. A subscriber provides the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">local workspace traversal</span>: a subscriber 
    supports the traversal of the local workspace resources that are <em>supervised</em> 
    by the subscriber. As such, the subscriber has a set of <em>root</em> resources 
    that define the workspace subtrees under the subscriber's control, as well 
    as a <em>members</em> method that returns the supervised members of a workspace 
    resource. This traversal differs from the usual workspace resource traversal 
    in that the resources being traversed may include resources that do not exist 
    locally, either because they have been deleted by the user locally or created 
    by a 3rd party. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">resource synchronization state determination</span>: 
    For supervised resources, the subscriber provides access to the synchronization 
    state of the resource, including access to the variants of the resource. For 
    each supervised resource, the subscriber provides a <em>SyncInfo</em> object 
    that contains the synchronization state and the <em>variants</em> used to 
    determine the state.The subscriber also provides an <em>IResourceVariantComparator</em> 
    which determines whether two-way or three-way comparison is to be used and 
    provides the logic used by the SyncInfo to comparing resource variants when 
    determining the synchronization state. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">refresh of synchronization state and change 
    notification</span>: Clients can react to changes that happen to local resources 
    by listening to the Core resource deltas. When a local resource is changed, 
    the synchronization state of the resource can then be re-obtained from the 
    subscriber. However, clients must explicitly query the server to know if there 
    are changes to the resource variants. For subscribers, this process is broken 
    up into two parts. A client can explicitly <em>refresh</em> a subscriber. 
    In response the subscriber will obtain the latest state of the resource variants 
    from the remote location and fire <em>synchronization state change</em> events 
    for any resource variants that have changed. The change notification is separate 
    from the refresh since there may be other operations that contact the remote 
    location and obtain the latest remote state.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p> The APIs do not not define how a Subscriber is created, this is left to the 
  specific implementations. </p>
<p>
So let's revisit our first example of using SyncInfo and see how a
Subscriber could be used to access SyncInfo.</p>

<pre><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 204);">// Create a file system subscriber and specify that the<br>// subscriber will synchronize with the provided file system location<br>Subscriber subscriber = new FileSystemSubscriber("c:\temp\repo");<br><br>// Allow the subscriber to refresh its state<br>subscriber.refresh(subscriber.roots(), IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE, monitor);<br><br>// Collect all the synchronization states and print<br>IResource[] children = subscriber.roots();<br>for(int i=0; i &lt; children.length; i++) {<br>  printSyncState(children[i]);<br>}<br><br>...<br><br>void printSyncState(Subscriber subscriber, IResource resource) {<br>  System.out.println(subscriber.getSyncInfo(resource).toString());<br></span><span
 style="color: rgb(68, 68, 204);"><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 204);">  IResource[] children = subscriber.members(resource);<br>  for(int i=0; i &lt; children.length; i++) {<br>    IResource child = children[i];<br>    if(! child.exists()) {<br>      System.out.println(resource.getFullPath() + " doesn't exist in the workspace");<br>    }<br>    printSyncState(subscriber, children[i]);<br>  }<br>}<br></span></span></pre>
<p>
The important point to remember is that the Subscriber knows about
resources that do not exist in the workspace and non-existing resources
can be returned from the <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/subscribers/Subscriber.html#members(org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource)">Subscriber#members()</a>
and <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/synchronize/SyncInfo.html#getLocal()">SyncInfo#getLocal()</a>.
 </p>
<h3>Displaying the Synchronizations State in the UI</h3>
<p>
We could spend more time explaining how to manage synchronization state
but instead let's see how to actually get the state shown to the user.
A <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/ui/synchronize/ISynchronizeParticipant.html">ISynchronizeParticipant
</a>is the user interface component that displays synchronization state
and allows the user to affect its state. The Synchronize View displays
synchronize participants, but it is also possible to show these in
dialogs and wizards. In order to provide support for users to show any
type of synchronization state to the user, even those not based on
SyncInfo and Subscribers, a participant is a very generic component.</p>
<p>
There is also an extension point called <a
 href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_team_ui_synchronizeWizards.html">org.eclipse.team.ui.synchronizeWizards</a>
to add a synchronization creation wizard. This will put your wizard in
the global synchronize action and in the Synchronize View, so that
users can easily create a synchronization of your type.
</p>
<p>
However, if you have implemented a Subscriber you can benefit from a
concrete participant called <a
 href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/ui/synchronize/SubscriberParticipant.html">SubscriberParticipant
</a>which will provide
the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collects SyncInfo from a Subscriber in the background.</li>
  <li>Listens to changes in the workspace and those found when a
Subscriber is refreshed and keeps the synchronization state updated
dynamically.</li>
  <li>Provides the user interface that support modes for filtering the
changes, and layouts.</li>
  <li>Support scheduling a refresh with the Subscriber so that the
synchronization states are kept up-to-date.</li>
  <li>Supports refreshing a Subscriber in the background.</li>
  <li>Supports navigation of the changes and showing the differences
between the files.</li>
  <li>Supports configuration of the actions, toolbars, and decorators
by subclasses.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to explain these concepts are to see them used in the context 
  of a simple example. Go to the <a
 href="team_synchronize_localhistory_example.htm">local history synchronization</a> 
  example to see how all of these pieces can be used together. Or if you want 
  pointers on how to use the more advanced APIs, go to <a
 href="team_synchronize_beyond_basics.htm">Beyond The Basics</a>.<br>
