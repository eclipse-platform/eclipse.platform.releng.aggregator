<h2>
Workbench Resource Support</h2>
<P>
The Eclipse platform is structured so that you can develop a workbench application even if your application
has nothing to do with the platform resource model.  However, the workbench does provide support for
working with resources in a separate plug-in, <b>org.eclipse.ui.ide</b>.  This plug-in contains the
parts of the SDK workbench that focus on IDE building and manipulating the workspace.
</p>
<p>
If your plug-in uses the platform resource model, you may want to take advantage of the resource-oriented
features in the workbench.  These include resource property pages, resource marker UI, resource filtering, 
and other utilities.
