<h2>Workbench Key Bindings</h2>
<p>The workbench defines many keyboard accelerators for invoking common actions
with the keyboard.&nbsp; In early versions of the platform, plug-ins could
define the accelerator key to be used for their action when the action was
defined.&nbsp; However, this strategy can cause several problems:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Different plug-ins may define the same accelerator key for actions that are
    not related.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins may define different accelerator keys for actions that are
    semantically the same.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins may define accelerator keys that later conflict with the workbench
    (as the workbench is upgraded).</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to alleviate these problems, the platform defines a configurable key
binding strategy that is extendable by plug-ins.&nbsp; It solves the problems
listed above and introduces new capabilities:</p>


<ul>
  <li>The user can control which key bindings should be used.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins can define key bindings that emulate other tools that may be
    familiar to users of the plug-in.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins can define contexts for key bindings so that they are only active
    in certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic strategy is that plug-ins use <b>commands</b> to define
semantic actions.&nbsp; Commands are simply declarations of an action and its
associated category.&nbsp; These commands can then be associated with key
bindings, actions, and handlers.&nbsp; Commands do not define an implementation
for the action.&nbsp; When a
plug-in defines an action for an editor, action set, or view, the action can
specify that it is an implementation of one of these commands.&nbsp;
This allows semantically similar actions to be associated with the same command.</p>
<p>Once a command is defined, a <b>key binding</b> may be defined that
references the command.&nbsp; The key binding defines the key sequence that
should be used to invoke the command.&nbsp; A key binding may reference a
<b>scheme</b> which is used to group key bindings into different named
schemes that the user may activate via the
Preferences dialog.</p>
<p>This is all best understood by walking through the workbench and looking at
how commands and key bindings are declared.&nbsp; We'll look at all of this from
the point of view of defining key bindings for existing workbench actions.&nbsp; </p>
