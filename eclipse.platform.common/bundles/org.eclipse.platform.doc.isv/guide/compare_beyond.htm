Advanced compare techniques</H2>

<p>
This section provides additional information about advanced API in the compare
plug-in.</p>

<h3>Writing Compare Operations</h3>

<p>A compare operation must be implemented as a subclass of
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a>.&nbsp;
A
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a>
runs a (potentially lengthy) compare operation
under progress monitor control, creates a UI for drilling-down into the
compare results, tracks the dirty state of the result in case of merge,
and saves any changes that occurred during a merge.</p>

<p>

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareUI.html"><b>CompareUI</b></a>
defines the entry point to initiate a configurable
compare operation on arbitrary resources. The result of the compare is
opened into a compare editor where the details can be browsed and edited
in dynamically selected structure and content viewers.</p>
<p>

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/NavigationAction.html"><b>NavigationAction</b></a>
is used to navigate (step) through the individual
differences of a 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a>.</p>
<p>

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareConfiguration.html"><b>CompareConfiguration</b></a>
configures various UI aspects
of compare/merge viewers like title labels and images, or whether a side
of a merge viewer is editable. It is passed to the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a>
on creation.</p>
<p>

When implementing a hierarchical compare operation as a subclass of
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a>,
clients must provide a tree of objects where each
node implements the interface
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/IStructureComparator.html"><b>IStructureComparator</b></a>.
This interface is used by the hierarchical differencing engine
(<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/Differencer.html"><b>Differencer</b></a>) to walk the tree.
<br>
In addition every leaf of the tree must implement the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/IStreamContentAccessor.html"><b>IStreamContentAccessor</b></a>
interface in order to give the differencing engine access to its stream content.</p>
<p>

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/BufferedContent.html"><b>BufferedContent</b></a>
provides a default implementation
for the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/IStreamContentAccessor.html"><b>IStreamContentAccessor</b></a>
and
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/IContentChangeNotifier.html"><b>IContentChangeNotifier</b></a>
interfaces.
Its subclass
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/ResourceNode.html"><b>ResourceNode</b></a>
adds an implementation for the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/IStructureComparator.html"><b>IStructureComparator</b></a>
and
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/ITypedElement.html"><b>ITypedElement</b></a>
interfaces
based on platform workbench resources
(<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html"><b>IResource</b></a>). 
It can be used without modification as the input to the differencing engine.</p>


<h3>Compare Functionality Outside of Compare Editors</h3>


<p>If you want to use compare functionality outside of the standard compare editor 
(for example, in a dialog or wizard) the compare plug-in provides additional helper
classes.</p>

<p>

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareViewerPane.html"><b>CompareViewerPane</b></a>
is a convenience class which provides
a label and local toolbar for a compare viewer (or any other subclass of a <a href="jface_viewers.htm"> JFace
viewer</a>).&nbsp; Its abstract subclass
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareViewerSwitchingPane.html"><b>CompareViewerSwitchingPane</b></a>
supports <b>dynamic viewer switching</b>, that is the viewer installed in the pane is dynamically 
determined by the pane's input object.</p>

<h3><a id="single">comparing a Single File in an Editor</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/CompareEditorInput.html"><b>CompareEditorInput</b></a> supports
the comparison of an arbitrary file/folder structure which can be displayed in an editor, dialog or view. 
However, the specific case of comparing a single file in an editor warrants special handling because, in that case, the
desired behavior should be close to that of editing the file. So, for this purpose a subclass of CompareEditorInput
has been provided. The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/ui/synchronize/SaveableCompareEditorInput.html">
<b>SaveableCompareEditorInput</b></a> class provides this capability and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides a static method <code>createFileElement</code> for creating a type element that represents a file.</li>
<li>supports the use of shared documents (i.e. file buffers).</li>
<li>supports the workbench Saveables API.</li>
<li>auto-closes when changes are resolved.</li>
<li>initializes asynchronously.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="patch">working With Patches</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/patch/ApplyPatchOperation.html"><b>ApplyPatchOperation</b></a> provides
the ability to launch the Apply Patch wizard programmatically. The pages shown by the wizard are determined using the inputs to the operation.
The class also contains the static method <code>parsePatch</code> which can be used by clients to deal with patches in a custom manner.
