<H2>Virtual Folders</H2>
<p>
Virtual folders are folders that do not exist in the file system.
They are shown to the user with a unique folder icon.</p>
<p>
The method <b>IResource.isLinked</b> returns true for virtual folders, and 
<b>IResource.getLocation</b>/<b>IResource.getLocationURI</b> always returns null.</p>
<p>
Virtual folders can be created by passing the <b>IResource.VIRTUAL</b> flag to the <b>IResource.create</b> method.</p>
<p>
By design, virtual folders can only have linked resources or other virtual folders as children.
