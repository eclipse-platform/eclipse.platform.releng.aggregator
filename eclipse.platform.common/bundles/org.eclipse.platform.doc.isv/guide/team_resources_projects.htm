<h3>Project Sets</h3>
<p>Since the resources inside a project under version control are kept in the
repository, it is possible to share projects with team members by sharing a
reference to the repository specific information needed to reconstruct a project
in the workspace.&nbsp; This is done using a special type of file export for <b>team
project sets</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/projectset.png" alt="" border="0" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 3.0, API was added to <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/ProjectSetCapability.html">ProjectSetCapability</a> 
  to allow repository providers to declare a class that implements project saving 
  for projects under their control.&nbsp; When the user chooses to export project 
  sets, only the projects configured with repositories that define project sets 
  are shown as candidates for export. This API replaces the old project set serialization 
  API (see below). </p>
<p>The project set capability class for a repository provider is obtained from 
  the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/ProjectSetCapability.html">RepositoryProviderType</a> 
  class which is registered in the same extension as the repository provider. 
  For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.team.core.repository"&gt;
    &lt;repository
          typeClass=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSTeamProviderType&quot;
          class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSTeamProvider&quot;
          id=&quot;org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
<p>Prior to 3.0, The <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_team_core_projectSets.html"><b>org.eclipse.team.core.projectSets</b></a> 
  extension point allowed repository providers to declare a class that implements 
  project saving for projects under their control.&nbsp; When the user chooses 
  to export project sets, only the projects configured with repositories that 
  define project sets are shown as candidates for export.</p>
<p>For example, the CVS client declares the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.team.core.projectSets&quot;&gt;
	&lt;projectSets id=&quot;org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature&quot; class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSProjectSetSerializer&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
<p>The specified class must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/core/IProjectSetSerializer.html"><b>IProjectSetSerializer</b></a>. 
  Use of this interface is still supported in 3.0 but has been deprecated.</p>
