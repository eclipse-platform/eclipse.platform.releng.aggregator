    <h2>
      Adding Child Links to Help Pages
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Eclipse Help System recognizes two special comments in the source
      code which can be used to cause child links to appear in help topics.
      This is useful in the case of a help topic which is the parent of an
      anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the sequence
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!--INSERT_CHILD_LINKS--&gt;
</pre>appears in the source code it will be replaced with html containing
hyperlinks to all child topics.
    <p>
      If the sequence
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;!--INSERT_CHILD_LINK_STYLE--&gt;
</pre>appears in the source code it will be replaced by either
<code>"has_child_topics"</code> or <code>"no_child_topics"</code> depending on
whether or not the topic has children. This can be used to assign a style to a
section of html so that it will only be shown if the topic has children.
