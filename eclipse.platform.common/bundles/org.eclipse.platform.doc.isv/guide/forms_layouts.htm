UI Forms Layouts</H1>
<p>UI Forms offer two new layouts over those provided by SWT. These 
layouts implement the common interface and can be used on any UI SWT composite, 
but are typically used in conjunction with UI Forms. The purpose of these 
layouts is to manage form layout in a way that is similar to Web browsers. 
Controls are laid out with respect to the form width. The goal is to respect 
form width as much as possible and compensate by growing the form vertically 
(and employing scroll bars where needed).</p>
