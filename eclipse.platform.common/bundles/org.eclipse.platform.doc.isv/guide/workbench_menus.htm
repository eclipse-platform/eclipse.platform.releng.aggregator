We've seen several different extension points that contribute to various menus and toolbars in the workbench. How do you know which one to use? The following table summarizes the various menu contributions and their use.</P>

Commands can be placed in the main menu and toolbar.  Command can be placed in
part context menus, as well as view menus and view toolbars.  The placement
is controlled by the <b>locationURI</b> and the visibility is controlled by
