<h3>Alternate file systems</h3>

<p>
Most of the time, resources in the workspace are stored in a local file system
that is accessible via <tt>java.io.File</tt>.  However, it is also possible
to create resources that are stored in other kinds of file systems, such
as network file systems or a database.
</p>
<p>
The next few sections cover how to contribute alternative file systems, and how 
to work with resources stored in different file systems.
