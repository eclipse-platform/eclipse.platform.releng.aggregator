<H2>Structured Text Overview</H2>

<p>Languages like Arabic and Hebrew are generally written from right to left,
but included numbers and phrases in English must be written from left to right.
This is the origin of the term &quot;bidirectional&quot; which qualifies these languages.</p>
<p>In most computer environments, the text is stored in <em>logical</em> order
(the order the text is read) but is reordered into <em>visual</em> order for
presentation. For plain text, the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
(<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UBA</a>)
generally specifies satisfactorily how to reorder bidirectional text for
display. This algorithm, or close to it, is implemented in the presentation
systems of a number of platforms, giving them a good handle on bidirectional
support.</p>
<p>However, all bidirectional text is not necessarily plain text. There are also
instances of text structured to follow a given syntax, which should be reflected
in the display order. The general algorithm, which has no awareness of these
special cases, often gives incorrect results when displaying such structured
text.</p>
<p>This document describes various examples of this issue, and proposes a
methodology to solve the related problems. The types of structured text treated
in this document are all excerpted from actual products, including Eclipse.</p>
<p>For a general introduction to bidirectional concepts, the reader is kindly
referred to the following technical article: &quot;Bidirectional script support: a
primer&quot; available at
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/bidi/bidigen.html">

<h3>Working With Structured Text</h3>

<p>Eclipse provides support for correct presentation of structured text. The base 
functionality can be found in the package <b>&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.bidi&quot;</b>.
The methods <code>process()</code> and <code>deprocess()</code> and their variants
in class STextProcessor will be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Consumers who would like to adjust Bidi environment settings, process bidi 
text in portions, or directly manage directional formatting will find lower level
functionality available in the <b>&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.advanced&quot;</b> package.</p>

<p>Developers wishing to create handlers for types of structured text not
currently supported by Eclipse "out of the box" will create extensions for class STextTypeHandler
in package <b>&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.advanced&quot;</b>. Such new type handlers
should register with the <b>&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.bidiTypes&quot;</b> extension point.</p>
