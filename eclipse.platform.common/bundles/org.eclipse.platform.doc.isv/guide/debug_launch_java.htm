<h4>Launching Java Applications</h4>
<p>
In <a href="debug_launch_processfactories.htm">Process factories</a>, we saw how a system process is used to invoke
a program and how wrapping it with an <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/debug/core/model/IProcess.html"><b>IProcess</b></a>
allows clients to access launch-related information about the process.  These techniques are general and can be used to launch
any external program from the platform.
</p>
<p>Additional classes provided in the <b>org.eclipse.jdt.debug</b> plug-in provide support for launching a specific JRE with a specified
classpath, arguments, VM arguments, and a main type.  See the following references for more specific information about launching
a Java application:</p>
