Packaging and delivering Eclipse based products</H1>
<p>
  The Eclipse platform is designed so you can add plug-ins that provide functionality
  for the software development tools community.&nbsp; Commercial software
  vendors can build, brand, and package products using the platform as a base
  technology.&nbsp; These products can be sold and supported commercially.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The Eclipse SDK can be downloaded and used as a Java IDE and Eclipse plug-in
  development tool, but it is not marketed as a commercial product.&nbsp; The
  platform provides the raw ingredients for a product without a box, label, or
  price tag.&nbsp; It defines a file and directory structure that lets you
  easily customize the platform's about dialog and splash screen to brand your
  product.</p>
<p>
  The license governing the Eclipse platform gives you a lot of freedom over how
  to build and configure a product.&nbsp; However, Eclipse based products will
  coexist more easily on a user's system if the products use similar standards
  for packaging, configuring, and installing their products.</p>
