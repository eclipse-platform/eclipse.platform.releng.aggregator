<h1>Dialogs and wizards</h1>
<p>
We've seen how to extend the workbench UI by adding views, editors, and 
actions to the workbench.  We've contributed a preference page for controlling
the behavior of our plug-in.  Now we can tie it all together by launching our 
own dialogs in response to these actions.</p>
<p>
The JFace UI framework provides several standard dialogs and a framework for
building your own dialogs and wizards.  We'll look at the different kinds of dialogs and wizards and how to build
them.</p>
<p>
We'll also cover some simple workbench extensions for contributing wizards.</p>
