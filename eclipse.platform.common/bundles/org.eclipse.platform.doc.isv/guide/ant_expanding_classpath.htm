<h2>
Expanding the Ant Classpath</h2>
<p>Plug-ins can contribute 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ant_core_extraClasspathEntries.html">extra JAR files</a> 
to the Ant classpath. The plug-in contributing the JARs is added to the Ant classpath, and as a result,
classes inside the contributed JAR files will have access to all classes available to the plug-in. However, the 
reverse is not true. Since the contributed JAR files must be separate JARs, and not plug-in libraries,
the plug-in classes do not have access to the classes provided by the contributed JARs. The
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ant_core_extraClasspathEntries.html">
<b>org.eclipse.ant.core.extraClasspathEntries</b></a> extension point provides an example of how to specify the extra JARs 
in the plugin.xml file.</p>
