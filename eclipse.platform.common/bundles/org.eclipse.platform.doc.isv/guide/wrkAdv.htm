Advanced workbench concepts</H1>
<p>
<a href="workbench.htm">Plugging into the workbench</a> looks at the basic workbench extension points in the
context of the readme tool example.  However, there are many more extension points available for contributing to the
workbench.  
</p>
<p>The next topics cover additional workbench extensions and concepts that
you will likely encounter once you've implemented your plug-in and have begun to
refine its function.  In order to understand the next few topics, you should already be familiar
with
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="workbench.htm">Plugging into the Workbench</a></li>
  <li><a href="jface.htm">JFace UI framework</a></li>
  <li><a href="swt.htm">SWT</a></li>
  <li><a href="resInt.htm">Resources overview</a></li>
</ul>
Since the contributions plug-in does not contribute to all of these extension
points, we will look at example extensions that are implemented by the platform
workbench, the platform help system, and Java tooling (JDT).
<p>When using any of these workbench features, it is a good idea to
keep the rules of engagement for threading in mind.  See 
<a href="swt_threading.htm#workbench_threads">The workbench and threads</a> for more information.
