<h2>Using Content Types</h2>
<blockquote><i> Note:&nbsp; For this discussion, we specifically avoid the use 
  of the word <b>file</b> when talking about content. The runtime content engine 
  does not assume that content is contained in a file in the file system. However, 
  it does include protocol that allows content types to be associated with file-naming 
  patterns. In practice, these file names represent files in the file system, 
  but nothing in the implementation of the content system assumes that the content 
  is located in the file system. <a HREF="resInt_content.htm">File encoding and 
  content types</a> discusses the file-oriented content type capabilities contributed 
  by the platform resources plug-in and is a must-read for developers interested 
  in using the content type API in that context.</i></blockquote>
<h3>Finding Out About Content Types</h3>
<p>Content types are represented by <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentType.html">IContentType</a></b>. 
  This interface represents a unique content type that knows how to read a data 
  stream and interpret content type-specific information. Content types are hierarchical 
  in nature. For example, a content type for XML data is considered a child of 
  the text content type. This allows new content types to leverage the attributes 
  or behavior of more general content types. </p>
<p>The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b> 
  is the entry point that gives access to most of the content type related API 
  provided by the platform runtime. To obtain a reference to the platform <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b>, 
  clients can use the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/Platform.html">Platform</a></b> 
  API:</p>
<pre>IContentTypeManager contentTypeManager = Platform.getContentTypeManager();</pre>
<p> Clients can use the platform <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b> 
  to find out about the content types in the system. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>getAllContentTypes</b> allows clients to get all of the content types 
    defined in the platform. </li>
  <li><b>getContentType</b> allows clients to obtain a content type by its unique 
    identifier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detecting the Content Type for a Data Stream</h3>
<p>Given a stream of bytes, it is possible to determine its content type by calling 
  the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b> 
  API as follows:</p>
<pre>
InputStream stream = ...;
IContentType contentType = contentTypeManager.findContentTypeFor(stream, &quot;file.xml&quot;);
stream.close();
</pre>
<p>This will return the most appropriate <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentType.html"><strong>IContentType</strong></a> 
  given the input provided, or <code>null</code> if none can be found. Multiple 
  content types might be deemed appropriate for a given data stream. In that case, 
  the platform uses some heuristics to determine which one should be selected. 
  The file name is the first criterion by which content types are selected. It 
  can be omitted, but this has two issues: the results might not be as correct 
  because many unrelated content types might accept the same input; there is also 
  a big performance hit, since all content types in the platform have to be given 
  a chance of analysing the stream. So, unless it is not available, clients should 
  always provide a file name along with the stream.</p>
<h3>Describing a Data Stream</h3>
<p>Another interesting feature of the content type support in the platform is 
  the ability of <em>describing the contents</em> of a binary or character stream. 
  The following code snippet shows how to do that:</p>
<pre>InputStream stream = ...; 
IContentDescription description = contentTypeManager.getDescriptionFor(stream, &quot;file.xml&quot;);
stream.close();</pre>
<p>The returned <strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentDescription.html">IContentDescription</a></strong> 
  instance describes the content type and additional relevant information extracted 
  from the contents provided. The content description stores content-specific 
  properties in form of key/value pairs. The platform itself is able to describe 
  properties such as the character set and the byte order of text-based streams, 
  but others can be defined by content type providers.</p>
<h3>Providing Content-sensitive Features</h3>
<p>New content types are often defined as specialization of existing ones. This 
  hierarchy establishes a &quot;is a&quot; relationship between a derived content 
  type and its base type. Plug-in developers must honor this when implementing 
  content sensitive features. If a given feature is applicable to a given content 
  type, the feature must be applicable to any derived content types as well. The 
  <strong>IContentType.isKindOf(IContentType superType) </strong>method allows 
  determining whether two <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentType.html"><strong>IContentType</strong></a>s 
  are related. The method <strong>IContentType.getBaseType()</strong> allows determining 
  the base type of a given <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentType.html"><strong>IContentType</strong></a>.</p>
