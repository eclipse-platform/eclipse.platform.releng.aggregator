    <h2>
      Configuring the UI Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some aspects of what the p2 UI presents and how it behaves are
      configurable using the <b><a href=
      "../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/p2/ui/Policy.html">Policy</a></b>

      class. You can configure an instance of this class (or subclass) in order
      to customize the UI for your application. This policy is registered as an
      OSGi service, and retrieved by the UI in order to make decisions about
      presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the application requirements, the policy instance may be
      configured in code, configured using internal preferences, or even by
      exposing some of the decisions to a user in a preference page. The policy
      allows you to control things such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>whether repositories (sites) are visible to the user, and whether the
      user is permitted to manipulate (add, enable, disable, remove) the sites
      that are used for install and update
      </li>
      <li>what software (installable units) is visible to the user when
      browsing software sites
      </li>
      <li>what software (installable units) is shown as the roots of the
      'Installed Software' page
      </li>

      <li>whether restart is required after updating an application
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Example: Installing From the Cloud
    </h3>
    <p>
      This kind of customization is best described by example. A common
      scenario in RCP applications is that the user should be able to update
      the application, or install additional software, from a controlled set of
      update sites. This is common in managed installations, where a systems
      administrator is maintaining an internal update site. From the user point
      of view, updates come from one "cloud" rather than individual software
      sites, and there is no visibility of software sites.
    </p>
    <p>

      In this example, we want the UI to behave in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>we do not want to expose any site management function or site
      preferences
      </li>
      <li>we do not want to expose the standard SDK update preferences, but
      instead use our own values
      </li>
      <li>we want to contribute the standard installation pages (allowing
      access to uninstall, update, and revert)
      </li>
      <li>we want to allow automatic updating using the standard preference
      page
      </li>

      <li>we group the application preferences and update menu items in a
      <b>Tools</b> menu
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A sample RCP Mail application which does this kind of customization can
      be found <a href=
      "http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.p2.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/">
      here</a>. The most important aspect of this example is that we need to
      configure the p2 UI <b><a href=
      "../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/p2/ui/Policy.html">Policy</a></b>

      according to our requirements and register it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will register our policy in the startup code of the existing RCP Mail
      bundle class.
    </p>
    <pre>
 public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
  super.start(context);
  plugin = this;
  // XXX register the p2 UI policy
  registerP2Policy(context);
  getPreferenceStore().addPropertyChangeListener(getPreferenceListener());
 }
</pre>
    <p>
      The registration method creates a default policy instance, updates it
      according to some preference values, and registers it.
    </p>

    <pre>
 private void registerP2Policy(BundleContext context) {
  policy = new CloudPolicy();
  policy.updateForPreferences();
  policyRegistration = context.registerService(Policy.class.getName(), policy, null);
 }
</pre>
    <p>
      In this example, we wish to initialize a policy instance that prevents
      the user from manipulating the repositories. There are several ways to go
      about this. The most direct way is that the policy initializes its
      desired values on construction.
    </p>
    <pre>
public class CloudPolicy extends Policy {
 public CloudPolicy() {
  // XXX User has no visibility for repos
  setRepositoriesVisible(false);
 }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      A more general approach is for the policy to derive its values from
      preference settings. These preferences are not exposed to the end user,
      but are used to control how the policy initializes itself. This is the
      approach taken in the cloud example. The advantage of such an approach is
      that the policy can be configured by altering the preference values in
      the <b>plugin_customization.ini</b> file for the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      The policy code simply reads preference settings and adjusts the policy
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <pre>
 public void updateForPreferences() {
  IPreferenceStore prefs = Activator.getDefault().getPreferenceStore();
  setRepositoriesVisible(prefs
    .getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.REPOSITORIES_VISIBLE));
  setRestartPolicy(prefs.getInt(PreferenceConstants.RESTART_POLICY));
  setShowLatestVersionsOnly(prefs
    .getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.SHOW_LATEST_VERSION_ONLY));
  setGroupByCategory(prefs
    .getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.AVAILABLE_GROUP_BY_CATEGORY));
  setShowDrilldownRequirements(prefs
    .getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.SHOW_DRILLDOWN_REQUIREMENTS));
  if (prefs.getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.AVAILABLE_SHOW_ALL_BUNDLES))
   setVisibleAvailableIUQuery(QueryUtil.ALL_UNITS);
  else
   setVisibleAvailableIUQuery(QueryUtil.createIUGroupQuery());
  if (prefs.getBoolean(PreferenceConstants.INSTALLED_SHOW_ALL_BUNDLES))
   setVisibleAvailableIUQuery(QueryUtil.ALL_UNITS);
  else
   setVisibleAvailableIUQuery(new UserVisibleRootQuery());

 }
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, the <b>plugin_customization.ini</b> file can be edited according to
      the desired policy. A sample file that explains all of the configurable
      aspects of the policy is included in the example. It looks something like
      this.
    </p>

    <pre>
# we can configure the update UI by using application preferences to initialize the default UI policy

# should user be able to see and manipulate repositories in the install wizard
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/repositoriesVisible=false

# force restart after a provisioning operation (see possible values in org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.Policy.restartPolicy())
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/restartPolicy=1

# show only latest versions when browsing for updates
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showLatestVersionOnly=true

# software should be grouped by category by default
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/groupByCategory=true

# show only groups (features) in the available list, not every bundle
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showAllBundlesAvailable=false

# show only the install roots in the installed software list
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showAllBundlesInstalled=false

# do not drilldown into requirements in the wizards, just show the high level things
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showDrilldownRequirements=false

# automatic update options are defined in org.eclipse.equinox.p2.sdk.scheduler.PreferenceConstants

# check for updates on startup
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.scheduler/enabled=true
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.scheduler/schedule=on-startup

# remind the user every 4 hours
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.scheduler/remindOnSchedule=true
# see AutomaticUpdatesPopup, values can be "30 minutes", "Hour", "4 Hours"
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.scheduler/remindElapsedTime=4 Hours

# download updates before notifying the user
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.scheduler/download=true
</pre>
    <p>
      The rest of the UI code in the cloud example is based on code from
      <b>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk</b>. We copy the command handlers for
      install and update, and choose not to use any of the preference pages.
      The <b>plugin.xml</b> contributions for the standard installation pages
      are also included. The page implementations are contained in the p2 UI
      bundle, so we only need to define the names of the pages and point to the
      existing implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result is an application whose install and update UI looks
      familiar. The most significant change is that the <b>Install New
      Software...</b> wizard no longer provides any control over which sites
      are shown. Only the content from sites preconfigured in the product
      (using the <b>p2.inf</b> file in our example) are shown.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      Example: Customizing the UI Queries
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Eclipse SDK and the examples shown so far use the default p2 UI
      Policy queries that control the visibility of software items. In
      practice, this means that only Eclipse features are shown when browsing
      the various update sites. However, p2 does not have any specific
      knowledge of Eclipse features, nor does it require that installation and
      update operations be based on features. Similarly, only items actually
      installed by the end user, (or defined as installed items at
      product-build time), are shown in the <b>Installed Software</b> page.
      This is done to simplify the view of the installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your application can change the visibility of items in the UI by defining
      customized queries for obtaining the available or installed software. In
      this example, we'll replace the filtered queries normally used by the
      Eclipse SDK with queries that show everything available. (We'll also show
      how this can be achieved by altering the preference settings in the Cloud
      example. The approach taken in this example is shown in order to
      demonstrate how the queries can be replaced with application-defined
      queries. For example, the query could be modified to show only IU's with
      a certain property, or only those whose ids are associated with the
      application).
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete example is available <a href=
      "http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.p2.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.sdkbundlevisibility/">
      here</a>. When installing new software, every available bundle is shown in
      the install wizard. (Note that you must uncheck the <b>Group items by
      category</b> checkbox to see this list.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <img border="0" src="images/p2allbundles.png" alt=
      "Example Install Wizard showing all bundles in the repository">
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, the <b>Installed Software</b> page shows every bundle in the
      installation, not just the "root" of the product and the user-installed
      items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img border="0" src="images/p2allbundlesinstalled.png" alt=
      "Example Installed Software page showing all bundles that are installed">

    </p>
    <p>
      The steps for building the contributions are similar to those for the
      Cloud example above. This time, the policy class is called
      <b>AllIUsAreVisiblePolicy</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
public class AllIUsAreVisiblePolicy extends Policy {
 public AllIUsAreVisiblePolicy() {
  // XXX Use the pref-based repository manipulator
  setRepositoryPreferencePageId(PreferenceConstants.PREF_PAGE_SITES);
  
  // XXX All available IU's should be shown, not just groups/features
  setVisibleAvailableIUQuery(InstallableUnitQuery.ANY);
  // XXX All installed IU's should be shown, not just the user-installed.
  setVisibleInstalledIUQuery(InstallableUnitQuery.ANY);
 }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      The queries that retrieve the visible available software, and the visible
      installed software, are set so that all Installable Units are shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, we use OSGi declarative services to register the policy.
      Rather than manually register the service when our example Activator
      starts, we instead declare the service in a <b>policy_component.xml</b>
      file. Using declarative services is not necessary in this particular
      example, but could become necessary if we were to separate our p2 UI
      contributions into another bundle. In that case, it becomes possible for
      p2 UI components that use the policy (the preference page or installation
      pages) to be invoked before the bundle that configures the policy starts.
      Declarative services ensures that the policy is found and the bundle
      starts when the service is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned previously, the Cloud example preferences may also be used
      to make everything visible in the UI. This can be done by editing the
      <b>plugin_customization.ini</b> file in the example.
    </p>

    <pre>
# show only groups (features) in the available list, not every bundle
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showAllBundlesAvailable=true

# show only the install roots in the installed software list
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.cloud/showAllBundlesInstalled=true
</pre>
    <h3>
      Modifying the p2 UI Policy While Reusing the p2 UI Feature
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because the p2 UI Policy is defined as an OSGi service, products that
      ship with the <b>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui</b> feature unmodified
      can still provide an alternate implementation of the UI Policy. The
      <b>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk</b> bundle declares the service with a
      default ranking value (0). This means that the product must supply a
      policy implementation with a higher service ranking. When the policy
      service is found, the highest ranking policy will win. A sample file that
      declares a policy with a ranking of 1000 can be found <a href=
      "http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.p2.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.examples.rcp.sdkbundlevisibility/OSGI-INF/policy_component.xml">
