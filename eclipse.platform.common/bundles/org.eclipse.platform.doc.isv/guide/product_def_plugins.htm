<h2>Plug-ins and Fragments</h2>
<p>Features are described in terms of the plug-ins that comprise them. A <strong>plug-in</strong> 
is used to group your code into a modular, extendable and sharable unit.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>modular</em> as each plug-in contains some portion of code.  The plug-in specifies 
other plug-ins (or java packages) it requires to be available to run and it also specifies the set of 
java packages it provides.  An Eclipse based <a href="product.htm">product</a> will contain
multiple plug-ins, which can be added, replaced or removed to alter the functionality of the program.</p>

<p>Eclipse plug-ins are based on OSGi bundles.  OSGi is used to manage the plug-ins in a product.  A 
plug-in must contain a <a href="../reference/misc/bundle_manifest.html">manifest file</a> with valid 
OSGi headers for plug-in name and version.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>extendable</em> using <a href="product_extension.htm">extensions and extension points</a>.  
A plug-in can provide one or more extension points so other plug-ins can add to the functionality of 
the plug-in.  A plug-in may also provide extensions to connect to other plug-ins. To use extensions you must 
provide a <a href="../reference/misc/plugin_manifest.html">plugin.xml</a> file.</p>

<p>A <strong>fragment</strong> is used to replace or extend the functionality of
an existing plug-in.  A common use for fragments is to put environment (operating system,
architecture, etc.) specific code into fragments.  Depending on the environment the 
plug-in is installed in the base plug-in code along with the correct fragment can be installed.
Fragments are also ideal for shipping features like language or maintenance packs that typically 
trail the initial products for a few months.</p>

<p>When a fragment is detected by the platform and its parent plug-in is found, 
the fragment's libraries, extensions and extension points are &quot;merged&quot; with 
those of the parent plug-in. While this merging mechanism is good from a runtime point of view,
developers need to view fragments as separate entities while working on them. Fragments require
a valid OSGi manifest.  To use extensions and extension points they must define a fragment.xml
file which has the same structure as a plugin.xml file.</p>

<p>Plug-ins and fragments can be packaged in <a href="../reference/misc/plugin_archive.html">Plug-in
archive</a> files</p>
