<h3>File System Providers</h3>

<p>
By default, the <code>org.eclipse.core.filesystem</code> plug-in only includes a file system
implementation for the local file system.  Plug-ins can contribute implementations
for other file systems using the 
<b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_filesystem_filesystems.html">org.eclipse.core.filesystem.filesystems</a></b> 
extension point.  File system providers must provide subclasses of 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/filesystem/provider/FileStore.html">FileStore</a></b>
and
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/filesystem/provider/FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a></b>.
Minimally, all abstract methods must be implemented, but other methods can be
overridden to provide more efficient implementations of methods such as copy,
move, delete, etc.  Refer to the javadoc on these classes for more details on
what the default implementations do, and for advice on how and when to override
each method.
