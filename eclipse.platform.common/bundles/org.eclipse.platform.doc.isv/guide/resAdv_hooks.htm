Resource modification hooks</H2>
<P >So far, we've assumed that resource API is being used to modify resources
that are located in the user's file system.&nbsp; This is indeed the fundamental
structure of the workspace, but it's also possible that a plug-in adds
capabilities for manipulation of resources that are managed somewhere
else.&nbsp; For example, the platform <a href="team.htm">Team support</a>
plug-ins add the ability to work with resources that are under the management of
a versioning repository.</P>

<P > The resource API includes capabilities that have been added specifically 
  to enable the team support plug-ins and plug-ins that implement repository providers 
  using the team support.&nbsp; The following discussion covers the generic mechanism 
  for registering resource hooks.&nbsp; See <a href="team_provider_repository.htm#hooks">Implementing 
  a repository provider</a> for a discussion of how team uses these hooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<h3 >
Resource Move/Delete Hooks</h3>

<P >
This hook allows the team plug-in and its providers to control
    how resource moves and deletes are implemented.&nbsp; The hook includes the ability to prevent
these operations from
    happening.&nbsp; Implementers can provide alternate implementations for
    moving or deleting files, folders, and projects.&nbsp;</P>

<P >
The team plug-in uses the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_moveDeleteHook.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.resources.moveDeleteHook</b></a>
extension point to register its hook:</P>

<pre >&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.moveDeleteHook&quot; id=&quot;MoveDeleteHook&quot;&gt;
	&lt;moveDeleteHook class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.core.MoveDeleteManager&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<P >
The supplied class must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/team/IMoveDeleteHook.html"><b>IMoveDeleteHook</b></a>,
which is called by the platform whenever a resource is moved or deleted.&nbsp;
The team plug-in installs a move delete hook manager that can determine which
team provider is managing a resource and invoke its specific hook.</P>

<h3 >
File Modification Validators</h3>

<p>It's also possible that team repository providers will need to prevent or
intervene in the editing or saving of a file. The team plug-in
accomplishes this by using the extension point <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_fileModificationValidator.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.resources.fileModificationValidator</b></a>
to register a validator that is called whenever a resource is to be modified.</p>

<pre >&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.fileModificationValidator&quot; id=&quot;FileValidator&quot;&gt;
	&lt;fileModificationValidator class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.core.FileModificationValidatorManager&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>

<P >The supplied class must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/team/FileModificationValidator.html"><b>FileModificationValidator</b></a>,
which is called by the platform whenever a resource is saved or
opened. The team plug-in installs a file modification manager that
can determine which team provider is managing a resource and invoke its specific
validator.</P>

<h3 >General Team Hook</h3>
<p>
Repository providers sometimes need to hook into additional workspace operations
in order to impose extra restrictions or customize workspace behavior.  The
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_teamHook.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.resources.teamHook</b></a>
extension point provides some other special functions for team providers.  In particular,
this hook allows a team provider to decide whether linked folders and files should
be allowed for a given project.  Some repository systems have strict rules about the
physical layout of projects on disk, and are not able to handle resources linked to
arbitrary locations.</p>
<p>
The team hook also allows a repository provider to supply a 
<a href="runtime_jobs_rules.htm">scheduling rule</a>
factory that will be used by all workspace operations.  Each time an API method is called
that modifies the workspace in some way, a scheduling rule is obtained by the workspace.
This scheduling rule prevents other threads from modifying those resources during
the invocation of the API method.  If a repository provider is performing additional
work inside a file modification validator or move/delete hook, the provider must
also tell the workspace what additional scheduling rules it will need. See
the section on <a href="resAdv_batching.htm">resource batching</a> for more
details on how the workspace uses scheduling rules.
</p>
<P >The supplied class for the team hook must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/team/TeamHook.html"><b>TeamHook</b></a>.
The team plug-in installs the single team hook that
can determine which team provider is managing a resource and invoke its specific
hook.</P>

<blockquote>

  <P ><i>Note:&nbsp; All three of these team hooks are designed specifically 
    for use by the team core plug-in.&nbsp; They are not intended for general use.&nbsp; 
    Team providers should not install hooks using these extension points, but 
    instead implement their hooks in their Repository Provider class.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    See <a href="team_provider_repository.htm#hooks">Team resource modification 
    hooks</a> for more information about using these hooks.</i></P>
