<h2>Rich Client Platform (RCP) Help</h2>

<p>
The Help system is an <em>optional</em> Rich Client Platform (RCP) component. That
is, it is <em>not</em> part of the minimal RCP, but can be added to it. The following
plug-ins and all of their dependencies, including optional dependencies must be added to the RCP base in order to run the Help system:
</p>

<p>
<br>
org.eclipse.help.ui<br>
org.eclipse.help.webapp<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note</em>: Help contents will only be made available to the user if there is
content available. If there are no topics in the table of contents, the help will
not be available.
</p>

<h3>Setting the Help Server Port and Hostname</h3>
<p>The help server port and host name can be specified using virtual machine arguments as follows:</p><ul>	
	<li><b>-Dserver_port=&lt;port number&gt;</b> specifies the port number that the
	help server will use. </li>
	<li><b>-Dserver_host=&lt;host name&gt;</b> specifies the host name which will be used
	when the help system creates URLs which reference help pages.</li>
</ul>
