<h2>
Running Ant Buildfiles Programmatically</h2>
<p>
The Ant support built into Eclipse allows plug-ins to programmatically run Ant buildfiles.
This is done via the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ant/core/AntRunner.html"><b>AntRunner</b></a> 
class included in the <b> org.eclipse.ant.core</b> plug-in.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet shows an example of how to use the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ant/core/AntRunner.html"><b>AntRunner</b></a> from within code of another plug-in:</p>

<pre>import org.eclipse.ant.core.AntRunner;
import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor;

...

public void runBuild() {
	IProgressMonitor monitor = ...
	AntRunner runner = new AntRunner();
	runner.setBuildFileLocation(&quot;c:/buildfiles/build.xml&quot;);
	runner.setArguments(&quot;-Dmessage=Building -verbose&quot;);
	runner.run(monitor);
}</pre>

<p>If a progress monitor is used, it is made available for the running tasks.
See <a href="./ant_contributing_task.htm#monitor">Progress Monitors</a> for more details.
</p><p>Note that only one Ant build can occur at any given time if the builds do not occur in separate VMs. See <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ant/core/AntRunner.html#isBuildRunning()">
AntRunner.isBuildRunning()</a>;
</p>

<h3>
Special Care for Native Libraries if Build Occurs Within the Same JRE as the Workspace</h3>
<P >
Every time an Ant buildfile runs in Eclipse a new classloader is created. Since a library can only be
loaded by one classloader in Java, tasks making use of native libraries could run into problems during
multiple buildfile runs. If the previous classloader has not been garbage collected at the time the new
classloader tries to load the native library, an exception is thrown indicating the problem and the
build fails. One way of avoiding this problem is having the library load be handled by
a class inside a plug-in library. The task can make use of that class for accessing native
methods. This way, the library is loaded by the plug-in classloader and it does not run into the
load library conflict.
