<h3>Team Decorators </h3>
<p>Since any view that shows resources can contain projects that are configured 
  with different team providers, it is helpful for team providers to contribute 
  <a href="workbench_advext_decorators.htm">decorators</a> that distinguish resources 
  configured for their repository.&nbsp; The CVS client uses decorators to show 
  information such as a dirty flag (the &gt; symbol), tags, keywords (e.g. &quot;(ASCII 
  -kkv)&quot;), and revisions (e.g. &quot;1.15&quot;). Icons can also be decorated 
  (e.g. the <img src="images/team-version_controlled.png" alt="version control icon"> 
  symbol indicates that the resource is managed by CVS).</p>

<p><img src="images/teamdecorators.png" alt="Resource navigator with team decorators turned on">
</p>

<p>Some decorators may be expensive to compute, so it's a good idea to allow the
users some control over the use, or even content, of decorators.&nbsp; The CVS
client provides a preference page that allows users to control the presentation
and content of decorators.

<p>See <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_decorators.html"><b>org.eclipse.ui.decorators</b></a>
for a complete description of the decorator extension point.&nbsp; The CVS
decorator markup is as follows:
</p>

<pre>&lt;extension
     point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.decorators&quot;&gt;
  &lt;decorator
        objectClass=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource&quot;
        adaptable=&quot;true&quot;
        label=&quot;%DecoratorStandard.name&quot;
        state=&quot;false&quot;
        class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSDecorator&quot;
        id=&quot;org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.decorator&quot;&gt;
     &lt;description&gt;
        %DecoratorStandard.description
     &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/decorator&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
