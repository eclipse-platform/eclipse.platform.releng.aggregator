Concurrency infrastructure</H2>
<p>
One of the major challenges of a complex system is to remain responsive while tasks are being performed.  This
challenge is even greater in an extensible system, when components that weren't designed to run together are
sharing the same resources.  The
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/package-summary.html"> org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs</a></b> 
package addresses this challenge by providing infrastructure for scheduling, executing, and managing 
concurrently running operations.   This infrastructure is based on the use of <i>jobs</i> to represent
a unit of work that can run asynchronously.</p>
<h3>Jobs</h3>
The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/Job.html">Job</a></b> class represents
a unit of asynchronous work running concurrently with other jobs.  To perform a task, a plug-in creates 
a job and then <i>schedules</i> it.  Once a job is scheduled, it is added to a job queue managed by the 
platform.  The platform uses a background scheduling thread to manage all of the pending jobs.  As a running
job completes, it is removed from the queue and the platform decides which job to run next.  When a job 
becomes active, the platform invokes its <b>run()</b> method.  Jobs are best demonstrated with a simple example:
<pre>
   class TrivialJob extends Job {
      public TrivialJob() {
         super("Trivial Job");
      }
      public IStatus run(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
         System.out.println("This is a job");
         return Status.OK_STATUS;
      }
   }
</pre>
The job is created and scheduled in the following snippet:
<pre>
   TrivialJob job = new TrivialJob();
   System.out.println("About to schedule a job");
   job.schedule();
   System.out.println("Finished scheduling a job");
</pre>
The output of this program is timing dependent.  That is, there is no way
to be sure when the job's <b>run</b> method will execute in relation
to the thread that created the job and scheduled it.  The output will
either be:
<pre>
   About to schedule a job
   This is a job
   Finished scheduling a job
</pre>
or:
<pre>
   About to schedule a job
   Finished scheduling a job
   This is a job
</pre>

<p>
If you want to be certain that a job has completed before continuing, you can use
the <b>join()</b> method.  This method will block the caller until the job has completed, or 
until the calling thread is interrupted.  Let's rewrite our snippet from above in a more 
deterministic manner:
</p>
<pre>   TrivialJob job = new TrivialJob();
   System.out.println("About to schedule a job");
   job.schedule();
   job.join();
   if (job.getResult().isOk())
      System.out.println("Job completed with success");
   else
      System.out.println("Job did not complete successfully");
</pre>
Assuming the <b>join()</b> call is not interrupted, this method is guaranteed to
return the following result:
<pre>
   About to schedule a job
   This is a job
   Job completed with success
</pre>
<p>
Of course, it is generally not useful to join a job immediately after scheduling it,
since you obtain no concurrency by doing so. In this case you might as well do the work
from the job's run method directly in the calling thread.  We'll look at some examples later on where 
the use of join makes more sense.
</p>
<p>
The last snippet also makes use of the job <b>result</b>.  The result
is the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/IStatus.html">IStatus</a></b>
object that is returned from the job's <b>run()</b> method.  You can use this result
to pass any necessary objects back from the job's run method.  The result can also be used to
indicate failure (by returning an <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/IStatus.html">IStatus</a></b>
with severity <b>IStatus.ERROR</b>), or cancellation (<b>IStatus.CANCEL</b>).
</p>
<h3>Common Job Operations</h3>
<p>
We've seen how to schedule a job and wait for it complete, but there are many other
interesting things you can to do jobs.  If you
schedule a job but then decide it is no longer needed, the job can be stopped using
the <b>cancel()</b> method.  If the job has not yet started running when canceled,
the job is immediately discarded and will not run.  If, on the other hand, the job 
has already started running, it is up to the job whether it wants to respond to the cancellation.
When you are trying to cancel a job, waiting for it using the <b>join()</b> method comes in handy.
Here is a common idiom for canceling a job, and waiting until the job is finished before
proceeding:</p>
<pre>   if (!job.cancel())
      job.join();
</pre>
<p>If the cancellation does not take effect immediately, then <b>cancel()</b> will return 
false and the caller will use <b>join()</b> to wait for the job to successfully cancel.
</p>
<p>
Slightly less drastic than cancellation is the <b>sleep()</b> method.  Again,
if the job has not yet started running, this method will cause the
job to be put on hold indefinitely.  The job will still be remembered by the platform,
and a <b>wakeUp()</b> call will cause the job to be added to the wait
queue where it will eventually be executed. 
</p>
<h3>Job States</h3>
<p>
A job goes through several states during its lifetime.  Not only can it be manipulated through API
such as <b>cancel()</b> and <b>sleep()</b>, but its state also changes as the platform runs and completes the
job.  Jobs can move through the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WAITING</b> indicates that the job been scheduled to run, but is not running yet.</li>
<li><b>RUNNING</b> indicates that the job is running.</li>
<li><b>SLEEPING</b> indicates that the job is sleeping due to a sleep request or because it was scheduled
to run after a certain delay.</li>
<li><b>NONE</b> indicates that the job is not waiting, running, or sleeping.  A job is in this state when
it has been created but is not yet scheduled.  It is also in this state after it is finished running or when
it has been canceled.</li>
</ul>
<p>A job can only be put to sleep if it is currently <b>WAITING</b>.  Waking up a sleeping job will put it back in the
<b>WAITING</b> state.  Canceling a job will return it to the <b>NONE</b> state.
</p>
<p>
If your plug-in needs to know the state of a particular job, it can register a <i>job change listener</i> that is
notified as the job moves through its life-cycle.  This is useful for showing progress or otherwise reporting on
a job.  
</p>
<h3>Job Change Listeners</h3>
<p>
The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/Job.html">Job</a></b> method
<b>addJobChangeListener</b> can be used to register a listener on a particular job.  
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/IJobChangeListener.html">IJobChangeListener</a></b>
defines protocol for responding to the state changes in a job:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>aboutToRun</b> is sent when the job is about to be run.</li>
<li><b>awake</b> is sent when a previously sleeping job is now waiting to be run.</li>
<li><b>done</b> is sent when a job finishes execution.</li>
<li><b>running</b> is sent when a job starts running.</li>
<li><b>scheduled</b> is sent when a job is scheduled and waiting in the queue of jobs.</li>
<li><b>sleeping</b> is sent when a waiting job is put to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these cases, the listener is provided with an
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/IJobChangeEvent.html">IJobChangeEvent</a></b>
that specifies the job undergoing the state change and status on its completion (if it is done).
</p>
<blockquote><i>
Note:  Jobs also define the <b>getState()</b> method for obtaining the (relatively) current
state of a job.  However, this result is not always reliable since jobs run in a different thread and may
change state again by the time the call returns.  Job change listeners are the recommended mechanism
for discovering state changes in a job.
</i></blockquote>
<h3>The Job Manager</h3>
<p>
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/IJobManager.html">IJobManager</a></b>
defines protocol for working with all of the jobs in the system.  Plug-ins that show progress or otherwise
work with the job infrastructure can use <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/IJobManager.html">IJobManager</a></b>
to perform tasks such as suspending all jobs in the system, finding out which job is running, or receiving progress
feedback about a particular job.  The platform's job manager can be obtained using 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/Job.html">Job</a></b> API:</p>
<pre>   IJobManager jobMan = Job.getJobManager();
</pre>
<p>Plug-ins interested in the state of all jobs in the system can register a job change listener on the job manager rather
than registering listeners on many individual jobs.  
</p>
<h3>Job Families</h3>
<p>
It is sometimes easier for a plug-in to work with a group of related jobs as a single unit.
This can be accomplished using <i>job families</i>.  A job declares that it belongs to a certain family by 
overriding the <b>belongsTo</b> method:</p>
<pre>
   public static final String MY_FAMILY = "myJobFamily";
   ...
   class FamilyJob extends Job {
      ...
      public boolean belongsTo(Object family) {
         return family == MY_FAMILY;
      }
   }
</pre>
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/jobs/IJobManager.html">IJobManager</a></b>
protocol can be used to cancel, join, sleep, or find all jobs in a family:
<pre>
   IJobManager jobMan = Job.getJobManager();
   jobMan.cancel(MY_FAMILY);
   jobMan.join(MY_FAMILY, null);
</pre>
<p>Since job families are represented using arbitrary objects, you can store interesting
state in the job family itself, and jobs can dynamically build family objects as needed.
It is important to use family objects that are 
fairly unique, to avoid accidental interaction with the families created by
other plug-ins. 
</p>
<p>
Families are also a convenient way of locating groups of jobs.  The method <b>IJobManager.find(Object family)</b> can
be used to locate instances of all running, waiting, and sleeping jobs at any
given time.
</p>

<h3>Completing Jobs Before Shutdown</h3>
<p>
Since jobs run concurrently, it is possible for your jobs to be still running when the platform
begins to shutdown. This is a dangerous situation, since after your plug-in stops it
may not behave correctly or be able to load classes. For this reason, it is important
for you to ensure all your jobs are canceled and completed in your plug-in's <code>stop</code>
method. As in the previous example, you can use a job family to ensure all jobs
scheduled by your plug-in are canceled and joined before your plug-in stops running.
