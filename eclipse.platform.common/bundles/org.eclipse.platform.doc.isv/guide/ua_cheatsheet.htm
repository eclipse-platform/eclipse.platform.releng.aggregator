<h2>Cheat Sheets</h2>

<h3><b>Guiding the User Through Tasks</b></h3>

<p>
Even when the platform UI filters out unneeded functionality, there is still a steep learning
curve faced by a new user.  The platform UI introduces several mechanisms for helping the user choose what
task needs to be done and guiding the user through the steps in that task.  These mechanisms are used by
the workbench itself to help guide Eclipse SDK users through tasks.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheat sheets can help guide the user through a series of 
steps in order to achieve some
overall goal.  Some steps can be performed by the cheat sheet, and some are described so that the user
can manually complete the step.</li>
<li>Composite cheat sheets 
can guide the user through larger problems by breaking that problem into tasks. 
Each task is represented by a simple cheat sheet. </li>
</ul>
