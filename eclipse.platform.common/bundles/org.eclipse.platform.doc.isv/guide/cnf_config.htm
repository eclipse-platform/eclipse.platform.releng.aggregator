<h1>Configuring the Common Navigator</h1>

<p>This section defines the configuration at a conceptual level;
some level of detail is omitted for clarity and conciseness. For the
complete details see the extension point documentation or the <a
	href="cnf_operation.htm">Operational Topics</a>
section.</p>

<h2>Viewer Configuration</h2>

<p>As the CommonNavigator is a View, it is added using the <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_views.html">org.eclipse.ui.views</a></b>
extension point. The CNF configuration aspects of the view instance are
specified with a corresponding <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_viewer.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.viewer</a></b>
extension point.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the CNF facilities for an arbitrary
TreeViewer (??? could this be any StructuredViewer). In this case you
still need to use this extension point, but it is used only to bind the
CNF view information with the NCEs. You then programmatically (??? how)
bind your Viewer with the NavigatorContentService.</p>
<p>The view may be associated with <b><a
	href="#contentExtension">Navigator Content Extensions</a></b> that define
how its content is found and rendered. The entries here are used to look
up NCEs, common filters and common wizards.</p>

<p>The view may also be associated with <b><a
	href="#actionProviders">Action Providers</a></b> that define code for
programmatic updating and provision of actions or retargetable actions.
The entries here are used to look up action providers.</p>

<p>The view may also be associated with <b><a
	href="#linkHelpers">Link Helpers</a></b> that define the relationship
between the selection in the view and the active editor.</p>

<p>Content extensions, common wizards, common filters, action
providers and link helpers are bound to the view using an
include/exclude mechanism and with the capability of pattern matching.
This allows the actual content extensions (defined below) to be
specified in a granular fashion such that views can select only those
they actually need. The point of the exclude part of the mechanism is to
exclude undesired items that were specified in the include statement.
For example, the include statement could specify
"com.mycompany.content.*" and exclude could remove the test content
extensions by saying "com.mycompany.content.test.*".</p>

<p>A view is always associated with a popup menu. One important part
of the popup menu configuration at this level is the insertion points,
which are the locations where menu items can be added depending on when
and where the menu is shown. By default, a standard set of insertion
points is provided (described in the extension point documentation).
However, you can can define your insertion points directly using <b>popupMenus</b>.
</p>

<p>You can also direct the view to use a specific popup menu by id
using <b>popupMenuId</b>, and you can indicate whether to ignore
platform action contributions to the menu.</p>

<p>In the startup case, it is necessary to call some content
extensions on the root node of the tree of the view in order to get the
initial set of children. This set of content extensions is specified by
setting the isRoot() property on the viewerContentBinding.</p>


<p>This defines:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>viewerContentBinding</b> - bind a Content Extension or
	Common Filter specified with the <b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/navigatorContent</a></b>
	extension point;</li>
	<li><b>viewerActionBinding</b> - bind action providers specified
	with the <b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/actionProvider</a></b>
	extension point;</li>
	<li><b>popupMenus</b> - defines the insertion points (standard
	places where menu items can be added) for the popup menu associated
	with the viewer. Mutually exclusive with popupMenuId.</li>
	<li><b>popupMenuId</b> - causes the view to use the menu defined
	by the <b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_popupMenus.html">org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus</a></b>
	extension point. Mutually exclusive with popupMenus.</li>
	<li><b>dragAssistent</b> - points to code that may provide extra
	transfer types to be used when starting a drag from the viewer.</li>
	<li><b>options</b> - specifies options used to control the
	presentation of the view. For example these allow hiding of menus and
	buttons shown at the top of the view. These options are defined by <b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/INavigatorViewerDescriptor.html">INavigatorViewerDescriptor
	</a> </b></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="contentExtension">Navigator Content Extension (NCE)</h2>

<p>A navigator content extension, specified with <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/navigatorContent</a></b>
defines a named collection of attributes (content provider class, label
provider class, icon, etc) to be enabled under certain conditions
(typically in response to selection in the navigator). An example of a
content extension is that for a resource. Content extensions are useful
to describe other model objects that might be included in the view.</p>

<p>The definition of content extensions is separated from their
association with a particular view instance allowing them to be shared
and reused. Each content extension has an id, which is used to bind it
with a view, and a display name which is presented to the user to allow
the content extensions to be activated or deactivated by the user
interface associated with the each view.</p>

<p>Content extensions may be active or not. This can be controlled
by the user using the Filters and Customization menu item of the navigator.
Inactive content extensions are not considered when processing the view.</p>

<p>The content extension defines the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>triggerPoints</b> - specifies the conditions when this
	content extension is enabled based on a given object. You can specify
	tests with core expressions on the object for which the content
	extension should be enabled.</li>
	<li><b>possibleChildren</b> - like triggerPoints, but used for the
	case where the parent of the desired content extension is known, like
	in the drop case where we need to determine which content extension is
	required to handle the drop based on the drop target which is the
	parent of the eventual object that will be added to the tree.</li>
	<li><b>enablement</b> - specifies an enablement that is both a <b>triggerPoints</b>
	and <b>possibleChildren</b>.</li>
	<li><b>labelProvider</b> - an <b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ILabelProvider.html">ILabelProvider</a></b>
	provides the text to be shown in the view.</li>
	<li><b>contentProvider</b> - an<b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ITreeContentProvider.html">ITreeContentProvider</a></b>
	provides the means of getting the parent and child objects for the
	viewer. Other interfaces are possible, see the extension point
	documentation for these.</li>
	<li><b>descriptionProvider</b> - <b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/IDescriptionProvider.html">IDescriptionProvider</a></b>
	provides a description that is shown in the status bar.</li>
	<li><b>activeByDefault</b> - indicates this content extension
	should be made active in the default configuration of the workbench
	(e.g. a new workspace).</li>
	<li><b>priority</b> - used to determine which content extension to
	use in the event that multiple extensions are enabled (based on their
	enablement conditions).</li>
	<li><b>icon</b> - used to associate the object with a specific
	icon.</li>
	<li><b>providesSavables</b> - indicates the content provider
	provides saveables. If true the content provider must adapt to
	SavablesProvider.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Filter</h3>

<p>A common filter, specified with <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/commonFilter</a></b>
defines a filter that is controllable by the user in the view. The
filter definition contains an id, a description that describes the
filter, a description that describes what is filtered out, and the
conditions (using core expressions) that identify objects the filter
suppresses.</p>
<p>The common filter is bound to the view using the <b>viewerContentBinding</b>
element of the viewer configuration.</p>

<h3>Common Wizard</h3>

<p>A common filter, specified with <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/commonWizard</a></b>
defines wizard that is to be shown in the new, import, or export menu.</p>
<p>The common wizard is bound to the view using the <b>viewerContentBinding</b>
element of the viewer configuration.</p>

<h3 id="actionProviders">Action Providers</h3>

<p>An action provider, specified with <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/actionProvider</a></b>
allows you to specify a class, subclassing <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/CommonActionProvider.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.CommonActionProvider</a></b>
that is invoked at right-click and selection time to allow you to
contribute to the popup menu or to the action bars.</p>

<p>Action providers may be defined at the top level of the extension
point, not associated with any content extension. These action providers
are named and then bound to the CommonViewer using the <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.viewer/viewerActionBinding</b>.</p>

<p>Action providers may also be associated with a content extension,
in which case they are active with the content extension. This is done
by including the action provider inside of the <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/navigatorContent</b>
extension point.</p>

<h3 id="linkHelpers">Link Helpers</h3>

<p>A link helper, specified with <b><a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_linkHelper.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.linkHelper</a></b>
allows you to control how the &quot;Link with Editor&quot; matches the
selection in the navigator with an editor and matches an active editor
with the selection in the navigator.</p>
