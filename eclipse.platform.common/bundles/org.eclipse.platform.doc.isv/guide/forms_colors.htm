Color and font management</H1>
<p>When using forms in a non-trivial way, it is important to share 
as much as possible to conserve resources. For this reason, color management 
should be separated from the toolkit when there are more than one form to 
handle.</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible to create one toolkit per form, but 
that is too wasteful if there are many forms. Instead:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Create one toolkit for all the forms that have the same life 
	cycle. For example, if creating a multi-page editor, create one toolkit per 
	editor and dispose it when editor is disposed. All the pages in the editor 
	should share this toolkit.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Create one color manager (<code>FormColors</code>) per 
	plug-in. When creating the toolkit, pass the color manager to the toolkit. 
	The toolkit will know that the colors are shared and will not dispose them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use platform support for fonts and if possible, use <code>
	JFaceResources</code> predefined fonts. Between default, 'banner' and 
	'header' fonts, you can accomplish a lot. Using many fonts is very confusing 
	for the user, and if you do manage your own, you must ensure alternatives 
	across platforms. The JFace fonts are guaranteed to work on all the 
	platforms Eclipse ships on.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Dispose the color manager on plug-in shutdown (don't assume 
	that plug-in shutdown also means platform shutdown - Eclipse runtime can 
	uninstall your plug-in dynamically while the platform is still running).</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Use form color manager to allocate all the colors needed by 
	the forms.</p></li>
</ul>
