<h1>Metadata Management</h1>
<p>
As described in the <a href="p2_overview.htm">overview</a>, p2 provides
facilities for software dependency management, and for performing all of the necessary
steps to get an application physically installed and configured into an end user's system.
The information that describes the dependencies between application components, and the steps
required to properly configure a running system is called the <em>p2 metadata</em>.</p>
<p>In many cases this metadata can be computed directly from the information in your plug-in
and feature manifests, and an extra step is simply required to <em>publish</em> this
data into a format suitable for consumption by p2. In other cases, a plug-in or
application developer may need to author or customize the p2 metadata for their
software. The following sections describe in more detail how to author and publish
p2 metadata for your application or plug-in.</p>
