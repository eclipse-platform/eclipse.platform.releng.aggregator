<title>Installing software using the p2 director application</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Installing Software Using the p2 Director Application</h1>
In addition to the "Software Updates" dialog, you can also perform
provisioning operations from a command line or script.
This is achieved using a tool called the director application. The director application
is a command line tool for installing additional software or uninstalling
software from an Eclipse-based product. This application is capable of provisioning a
complete installation from scratch or simply extending your application.
Depending on your needs, this application can be executed both inside and
outside of the target product being provisioned.

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Director application:</b> the application performing p2
	operations such as install or uninstall. This application is provided
	by the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app bundle.</li>
	<li><b>Provisioning operation:</b> an operation installing,
	uninstalling features.</li>
	<li><b>Target product:</b> the installation targeted by the
	provisioning operation.</li>
	<li><b>Builder:</b> an eclipse based application containing the
	director application bundle and its dependents.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Running Inside the Target Application</h2>
<p>In this mode, the provisioning operation happens from within the
targeted product that you are provisioning. It is equivalent to starting
up the targeted product and using the p2 UI to perform the equivalent
operation.</p>
<p>This means that the target application has to be in a runnable
state and has to contain the director application bundle. Also, since the
target product will have run, cache files will have been created in the
configuration folder (e.g. configuration/org.eclipse.osgi).</p>
<p>The following example shows the command line used to install CDT
into the SDK.</p>
<pre>
<code>
  &lt;targetProductFolder&gt;/eclipsec.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository https://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group/&lt;version&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Provisioning Without Running the Target Application</h2>
<p>In this case the provisioning operation happens "outside" of
the targeted product. The "targeted product" is *not* started. This
allows one to both modify an existing installation and create a complete
installation from scratch given proper metadata.</p>

<p>This also has the advantage that since the targeted product does
not need to be started, the provisioning operation can be performed on
any platform for any other platform (e.g. on my linux machine, one can
add plug-ins to a windows-based target application).</p>

<h3>Installing / Uninstalling IUs Into a Target Product</h3>
<p>To install or uninstall something into an existing target product
a few extra arguments than for the "inside" mode need to be set. These
mostly consist in providing the provisioning operation the ID of the
profile it needs to operate on, and where it is located on disk.</p>

<p>For example, if from a directory called "d:\builder" containing
the builder, you want to install CDT into an existing SDK located into
"d:\eclipse", you would use the following command line.</p>
<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository https://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group
   -tag AddCDT
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile</code>
</pre>
<p>Note that there is no need to describe the os/ws/arch of the
platform being targeted because all this information is already
available in the profile of the application in which we are
provisioning.</p>

<h3>Installing a Complete Product</h3>
<p>The creation of a complete product using the director application
only needs a few extra arguments compared to the previous example. Most of these
consist of values used to initialize the profile in which the
application will be provisioned.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates how to create a linux/gtk
installation of the Eclipse SDK provisioned into a folder called "d:\eclipse" using
a director application located in "d:\builder".</p>

<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.6
   -installIU org.eclipse.sdk.ide
   -tag InitialState
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile
   -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true
   -bundlepool d:/eclipse/
   -p2.os linux
   -p2.ws gtk
   -p2.arch x86
   -roaming
 </code>
</pre>
<p>The -p2.* arguments describe the os/ws/arch that the provisioned
product is targeting.</p>
<h3>Installing a Complete Product for macOS</h3>
<p>The creation of a complete product for the macOS Operating System requires
that the destination folder end with ".app/" as in the following example.

<pre>
 <code>
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -nosplash
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository https://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars
   -installIU org.eclipse.sdk.ide
   -tag InitialState
   -destination d:/eclipse/MyApp.app/
   -profile SDKProfile
   -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true
   -p2.os macosx
   -p2.ws cocoa
   -p2.arch x86_64
   -roaming
 </code>
</pre>
<p>For a macOS App product, you may also want to edit the Info.plist file, such as to
change CFBundleName to the name of your product.
