<H2>Creating Password Providers</H2>

<h4>Extending Password Providers</h4>

<p>When storing information (such as a password) in the secure storage, the information 
gets encrypted with a master password. The interesting question about this process is how to store 
the master password?</p> 

<p>The answer is in the password provider implementations. In a logical sense, password provider modules 
represent a trusted 3rd party, an external black box, which we trust to store our master password. That black 
box can be an operating system, some piece of hardware, or the user himself.</p>

<p>Several password provider modules are supplied with the SDK. They provide a basic &quot;fallback&quot; support 
and an improved support for some specific operating systems. For the most part you won't need to create 
a password provider - unless you'd like to add (or improve) integration with an operating system or add interaction 
with some specific hardware. In this case the set of password providers can be easily extended.</p>

<h4>Declaring a Password Provider</h4>

<p>The password provider modules have to be described as an extension to the extension point 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_equinox_security_secureStorage.html"><b>org.eclipse.equinox.security.secureStorage</b></a>. 
The extension must specify an ID; the qualified ID of the extension will be used as an ID of the provider  
module and must not be changed between releases. The optional name and description of the password provider 
show up in the 
   <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui.storage)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
  <strong>General &gt; Security &gt; Secure Storage</strong></a> 
preferences page and are visible to the end user.</p>

<p>Provider declaration includes the fully qualified class name that implements the provider, the numerical 
priority value, and a set of hints.</p> 

<p>The priority is used to select a password provider when new data is added to the secure storage. 
The enabled provider with the highest priority is used by default. (Note that this can be overridden 
programmatically using 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/provider/IProviderHints.html#REQUIRED_MODULE_ID">
<b>IProviderHints#REQUIRED_MODULE_ID</b></a> or by using the runtime option 
&quot;-eclipse.password&quot;.)</p>

<p>The priority is an integer number from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest priority. Consider adding your 
providers in the mid-range of priorities, 2 to 7, reserving top and bottom values.</p>

<p>An end user can disable a password provider via Secure Storage preferences page. Disabled providers are 
not considered when new data is added to the secure storage, but can be called on data retrieval if 
the data was originally encrypted with this provider.</p>

<p>Provider declaration can also specify a set of hints to help optimize interaction between the secure 
storage framework and the provider. The set of hints is open and can be extended in future. At the time 
of this writing the only expected hint is <b>&quot;AutomaticPasswordGeneration&quot;</b>. This hint 
informs the framework that the password provider creates a master password without user interaction.</p>

<h4>Implementing a Password Provider</h4>

<p>The class implementing the password provider must extend the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/provider/PasswordProvider.html">
<b>PasswordProvider</b></a> class. The central point of that class is the 

<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/provider/PasswordProvider.html#getPassword(org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage.provider.IPreferencesContainer,%20int)">
<b>getPassword()</b></a> method that returns the master password for the provider for the current user. The method 
receives hints when a new password is expected to be created (as opposing to retrieving previously generated 
master password).</p>

<p>If your password provider has user interaction or has alternative paths to obtain the master password, you might 
consider overriding the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/provider/PasswordProvider.html#retryOnError(java.lang.Exception,%20org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage.provider.IPreferencesContainer)">
<b>PasswordProvider#retryOnError()</b></a> method to inform the secure storage that the provider might 
be able to obtain a &quot;better&quot; password. For example, consider a password provider with the master password 
entered by the user. If the password entered was invalid, then the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/provider/PasswordProvider.html#retryOnError(java.lang.Exception,%20org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage.provider.IPreferencesContainer)">
<b>PasswordProvider#retryOnError()</b></a> method will be consulted to see if the password provider can 
obtain a correct password.</p>
