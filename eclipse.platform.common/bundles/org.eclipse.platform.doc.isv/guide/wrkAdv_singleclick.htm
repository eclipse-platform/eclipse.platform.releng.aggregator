<h2>Honoring Single Click Support</h2>
<p>The General <b>Preferences</b> allow users to specify whether views should 
  open their objects on single or double click. </p>


<p><img src="images/singleclick.png" alt="General &quot;Open mode&quot; preferences with disclaimer that the preference may not take effect in all views" style="border:0"></p>


<p>Why the disclaimer about this preference not working for all views?&nbsp;
Because views contributed by plug-ins must explicitly support this preference in
their implementation.</p>


<p>Recall that a view can be implemented by creating SWT controls and writing
standard SWT code, or by using <a href="jface_viewers.htm"> JFace viewers</a> 
to handle the low level details.&nbsp; Honoring
the single click preference can be done at either level.&nbsp; Most views that
open other objects present them in a structured, list-like view.&nbsp; We'll
focus on that kind of view for now.&nbsp; If your view displays objects in a
different manner, you'll likely use the SWT-level concepts to support single
click.</p>


<h3>Single Click in JFace Viewers</h3>


<p>If you are using a <a href="jface_viewers.htm#listviewer">JFace list-oriented
viewer</a> to present your objects, supporting single click is
straightforward.&nbsp; Instead of using <b>addDoubleClickListener</b> to trigger
opening the items in your view, use <b>addOpenListener</b>.&nbsp; The open
listener honors the current workbench preference, firing the open event when the
specified mouse event occurs.</p>


<p>You may still wish to use <b>addDoubleClickListener</b> for non-open actions,
such as expanding the items in a tree on double-click.</p>


<h3>Single Click in SWT Controls</h3>


<p>JFace provides a utility class, <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a>, 
  to handle the logistics of single and double click at the SWT control level.&nbsp; 
  The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a> 
  is configured by the General <b>Preferences</b> dialog so that it honors the 
  current workbench open preference. In fact, the JFace viewers use this class 
  to implement the open listener.&nbsp; </p>


<p>You must create an <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a>
and associate it with your SWT control.&nbsp; The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a>
will hook the appropriate events and interpret them based on the user
preferences.&nbsp; Your job is to add an open listener to the strategy that
implements the code for open.&nbsp; In this way, you are shielded from knowledge
about which widget event triggered the open event.</p>


<pre>OpenStrategy openHandler = new OpenStrategy(control);
openHandler.addOpenListener(new IOpenEventListener() {
	public void handleOpen(SelectionEvent e) {
	// code to handle the open event.
	...
	}
}</pre>
<p>The other workbench preferences for open (select on hover,
open using arrow keys) are also handled by <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a>.&nbsp;
This means that the &quot;right thing&quot; will happen if you use JFace viewers
or the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/util/OpenStrategy.html"><b>OpenStrategy</b></a>
class to implement open behavior.</p>
<h3>Activating Editors on Open</h3>
<p>When handling an open event, you should use <b>OpenStrategy.activateOnOpen() </b>to
determine whether an opened editor should be activated by default.&nbsp;
Activating an editor switches the focus from the view to the editor, which can
be particularly confusing and undesirable in single click mode. </p>
