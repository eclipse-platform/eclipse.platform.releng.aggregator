UI Forms controls</H1>
<p>UI Forms are based on SWT and JFace. Consequently, standard SWT controls are 
routinely used. However, a few custom controls have been added in order to 
deliver a rich web-style user interface when combined with the standard SWT 
control set:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="forms_controls_form.htm">Form</a></li>
	<li><a href="forms_controls_link.htm">Hyperlink</a></li>
	<li>
	<a href="forms_controls_section.htm">ExpandableComposite and Section</a></li>
	<li><a href="forms_controls_text.htm">FormText</a></li>
</ul>
