Master/Details block</H1>
<p align="left">Master/Details is a pattern used throughout the UI world. It 
consists of a list or a tree ('master') and a set of properties ('details') 
driven by the selection in the master. Eclipse Forms provide the implementation 
of the pattern as a useful building block with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">While details part is created, master part factory method is 
	abstract and must be implemented by the subclass</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Master and details parts are children of the sash form and 
	the ratio of the form space allocated for each can be changed by moving the 
	sash.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Through the nature of the sash form, master and details 
	parts can be organized horizontally or vertically in the form.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The idea of master/details block is to create a tree or a table 
section that fires the selection notification via the managed form. If the 
details part can handle the selected object, it should switch to the page for it 
and display properties. When building on top of the provided master/details 
block, subclasses should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Create the master part (the one that drives the details)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Contribute actions to the form tool bar (consumes 
	upper-right portion of the form in the title area)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Register details pages, one for each distinct input that can 
	arrive from the master part</p></li>
</ul>
