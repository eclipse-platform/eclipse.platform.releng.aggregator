Preference Pages</h2>
<p>
Once a plug-in has contributed extensions to the workbench user interface, it is common for
the plug-in to allow the user to control some of the behavior of the plug-in through
user preferences.
</p>
<p>
The platform UI provides support for storing plug-in preferences and showing them to the user
on pages in the workbench <b>Preferences</b> dialog. Plug-in preferences are key/value pairs, where the 
key describes the name of the preference, and the value is one of several different types.  (See
<a href="runtime_preferences.htm">Runtime preferences</a> for a detailed description of 
the runtime preferences infrastructure.)</p>
<p>How does a plug-in contribute a page for showing its preferences?  We will use the readme 
tool example to see how it contributes a preference page to the
workbench and then look at some of the underlying support for building preference pages.</p>
