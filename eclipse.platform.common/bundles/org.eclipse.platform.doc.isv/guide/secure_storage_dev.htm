<H2>Developing with Secure Storage</H2>

<h4>Central Classes and Interfaces</h4>

<p>The functionality of secure storage is exposed via APIs of the <b>org.eclipse.equinox.security</b> bundle. 

The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage</a></b> package contains several classes and interfaces that are likely 
going to serve as a starting point.</p>

<p>The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/SecurePreferencesFactory.html">
<b>SecurePreferencesFactory</b></a> can be used to obtain the root node of the secure preferences. The 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/SecurePreferencesFactory.html#getDefault()">
<b>SecurePreferencesFactory#getDefault()</b></a> method will return default secure preference root node. 
If you prefer your secure storage to be isolated from the rest of the application, you can use 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/SecurePreferencesFactory.html#open(java.net.URL,java.util.Map)">
<b>SecurePreferencesFactory#open(URL location, Map options)</b></a> method to open a secure storage corresponding to 
the location of your choice. This method also takes a map of optional hints that can be used to influence 
the behavior of this instance of secure storage.</p>

<p>The restrictions put on the node names are similar to the 
<a href="https://docs.osgi.org/javadoc/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/org/osgi/service/prefs/Preferences.html" title="Preferences specification in org.osgi.service.prefs"><b>OSGi Preferences</b></a>: 
no double forward slashes, no trailing forward slash. In addition, node names can only contain printable ASCII characters. 
If you need to use a string that does not fit those restrictions, the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/EncodingUtils.html">
<b>EncodingUtils</b></a> class can be used to convert the string into a compliant form.</p>

<p>The functionality provided by the nodes is described by the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/ISecurePreferences.html">
<b>ISecurePreferences</b></a> interface. You'll find this interface is very similar to the OSGi Preferences with 
a few minor differences. One of the differences is that many methods use 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/equinox/security/storage/StorageException.html">
<b>StorageException</b></a> to provide more detailed description of exceptions.</p>

<h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>The contents of the default secure storage can be seen in the 
   <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui.storage)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
  <strong>General &gt; Security &gt; Secure Storage</strong></a> 
preferences page. To enable modifications of the contents of secure storage, enable debug options of 
the <b>org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui</b> bundle. Enabling debug options will add context menus to the preferences 
page tree and to the values table. The context menus allow removal and addition of nodes and values to be performed 
directly from the preferences page.</p>

<p>You'll notice that context menus are disabled for the <i>&quot;org.eclipse.equinox.secure.storage&quot;</i> 
node. This node and its children are reserved for secure storage use and should not be modified directly.</p>
