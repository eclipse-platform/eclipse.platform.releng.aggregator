<h3>User Interface Support for Alternative File Systems</h3>

<p>In environments where there is more than one file system there are several 
  places in the user interface where the user can select a file system.</p>
<p>The UI support for additional file systems can be added via the<code> org.eclipse.ui.ide.fileSystemSupport 
  </code>extension point. The class attribute of these schema must be a<code> 
  org.eclipse.ui.ide.fileSystem.FileSystemContributor</code> which is used to 
  supply validation and browsing of the other file systems.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. New Project wizard with support for selecting alternative 
  file systems</strong></p>
<p>Above is the new Project wizard showing the extra support for multiple file 
  systems. When more than one <code> org.eclipse.ui.ide.fileSystem.FileSystemContributor</code> 
  is registered with Eclipse this selection will become available in the file, 
  folder and simple project wizards.</p>
