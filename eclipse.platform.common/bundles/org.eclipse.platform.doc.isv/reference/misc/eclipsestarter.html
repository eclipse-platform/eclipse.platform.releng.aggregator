<h1>Starting Eclipse From Java</h1>
<p>Last modified June 1, 2007</p>
<p>
The Eclipse Platform makes heavy use of Java class loaders for loading plug-ins. Even the Eclipse Runtime itself
and the OSGi framework need to be loaded by special class loaders. Client programs, such as a Java main program
or a servlet, cannot directly reference any part of Eclipse directly. Instead, a client must use
the <b>EclipseStarter</b> class in <b>org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor</b> to start the platform,
invoking functionality defined in plug-ins, and shutting down the platform when done.
</p>
<p>
Clients that do not need to access any particular function, but just need to start the platform, can use
<tt>org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.run()</tt> in the bundle <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.launcher</tt>.  However, clients that need to invoke specific functionality should use
<b>EclipseStarter</b>.  See the javadoc inside this class for details.
