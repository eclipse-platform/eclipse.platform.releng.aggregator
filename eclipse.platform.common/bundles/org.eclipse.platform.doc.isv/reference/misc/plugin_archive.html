<h1>
Plug-in Archives</h1>
Plug-ins and plug-in fragments are individually packaged as separate Java
.jars. Standard Java jar facilities are used for constructing plug-in archives.
There is no distinction made between a plug-in archive containing a plug-in
and one containing a plug-in fragment.
<p>The recommended convention for naming the plug-in archives is
<br><tt>&lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.jar</tt></p>
<p>Where <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt> is the plug-in or fragment identifier and <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt>
is the full version identifier contained in the respective plugin.xml or
fragment.xml. Note that this is a recommended convention that minimizes
chance of collisions, but is not required by the Eclipse architecture.
For example, the following are valid plug-in archive names:</p>
<p><tt>org.eclipse.platform_1.0.3.jar</tt>
<br><tt>org.eclipse.ui.nl_2.0.jar</tt>
<br><tt>my_plugin.jar</tt></p>
<p>Internally, each plug-in archive packages all the relevant plug-in or
fragment files relative to its plug-in or fragment directory (but not including
the directory path element). The archive has the following structure </p>
<p><tt>plugin.xml *OR* fragment.xml</tt>
<br><tt>other plug-in or fragment files and subdirectories</tt>
<br><tt>META-INF/</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java jar manifest and security files</tt>
