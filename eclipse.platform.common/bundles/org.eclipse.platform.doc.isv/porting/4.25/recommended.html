		1. <a name="pack200Removal">Pack200 artifacts will no longer be generated starting with 4.22 release</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients relying on availability of pack200 artifacts (*.pack.gz) in Eclipse Platform p2 repository.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Description:</strong> Clients using pack200 (*.pack.gz) artifacts from Eclipse Platform p2 repository are advised to stop doing so and
		rely on plain old *.jar files instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Action required:</strong> If your build system/scripts have strong requirement on existence of *.pack.gz artifacts for Eclipse Platform bits
		do the needed modifications so it can work when these are not around prior to starting to build against 4.22 release.
