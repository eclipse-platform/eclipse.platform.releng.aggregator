<h1>Incompatibilities Between Eclipse 4.36 and 4.37</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.36 and 4.37 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.36 plug-ins to 4.37. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.36 plug-in on 4.37.

<h2>1. <a name="native-fragments-merge">Multiple Platform-specific Fragments Merged Into Their Host</a></h2>
<p>
	The following platform-specific fragments have been merged into their respective host bundle:
	<ul>
		<li><code>org.eclipse.core.resources.win32.win32.x86_64</code></li>
		<li><code>org.eclipse.core.filesystem.win32.x86_64</code></li>
		<li><code>org.eclipse.core.net.linux</code></li>
		<li><code>org.eclipse.core.net.win32</code></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	All functionality formerly provided through these platform-specific fragments is now provided by the fragment's host bundle alone and no code change is required.
	If any of the mentioned fragments is referenced in a PDE <em>feature.xml</em> or listed as content of a product definition it just has to be removed.
