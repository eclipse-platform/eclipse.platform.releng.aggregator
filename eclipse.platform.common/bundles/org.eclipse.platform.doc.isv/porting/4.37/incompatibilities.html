<h1>Incompatibilities Between Eclipse 4.36 and 4.37</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.36 and 4.37 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.36 plug-ins to 4.37. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.36 plug-in on 4.37.
