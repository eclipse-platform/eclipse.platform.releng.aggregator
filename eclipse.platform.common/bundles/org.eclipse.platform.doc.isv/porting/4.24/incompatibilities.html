<h1>Incompatibilities Between Eclipse 4.23 and 4.24</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.23 and 4.24 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.23 plug-ins to 4.24. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.23 plug-in on 4.24.
