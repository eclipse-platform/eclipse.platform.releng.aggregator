<h2>1. <a name="Batik_Upgrade">Direct usages of Apache Batik CSS should be upgraded</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients directly using Apache Batik CSS bundles version <code>1.8.0</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Due to security vulnerabilities, we have updated the Apache Batik bundles used by Eclipse Platform to version <code>1.9.0</code>. Previously it was
using version <code>1.8.0</code>. Clients that were making direct use of the Apache Batik CSS APIs version <code>1.8.0</code> should
upgrade their code to work with version <code>1.9.0</code>. Other clients should not be affected. See <a href="https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">
Apache Batik website</a> for details.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong>
Clients should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade their code to work with Apache Batik CSS version <code>1.9.0</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <a name="Lucene_Index">Pre-built Lucene indexes should be updated</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients supplying pre-built Lucene help indexes.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
We have updated the Apache Lucene search engine to Lucene 7.0.0. This means that the indexes
built with 6.1.0 will not be readable anymore. See <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_0_0/changes/Changes.html">
Lucene Change Log</a> for details.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong>
Clients should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-build their indexes with Lucene 7.0.0 and supply them as before</li>
</ul>
