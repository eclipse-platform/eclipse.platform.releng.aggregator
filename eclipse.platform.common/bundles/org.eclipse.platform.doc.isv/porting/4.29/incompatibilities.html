<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.28 and 4.29</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.28 and 4.29 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.28 plug-ins to 4.29. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.28 plug-in on 4.29.
