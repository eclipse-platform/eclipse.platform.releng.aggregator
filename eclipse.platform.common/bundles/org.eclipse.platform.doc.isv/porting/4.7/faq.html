<h2><a name="lucene">1. Apache Lucene Bundle Changes</a></h2>
<p> As part of the migration to Lucene 6.1, the third-party Lucene bundles were updated from version 3.5 to 6.1.
<ol>
	<li>Bundle <code>org.apache.lucene.core</code> was bumped in version so consumers should not see any difference except the changes of Lucene itself (see link below).
	However some of the new classes were moved by the Lucene project to the <code>org.apache.lucene.misc</code> by making use of split-packages.</li>

	<li>Bundle <code>org.apache.lucene.analysis</code> was removed and it's functionality was split in two new bundles: <code>org.apache.lucene.analysis-common</code> and <code>org.apache.lucene.analysis-smartcn</code>.
	Consumers should be able to make use of <code>org.apache.lucene.analysis-common</code> for everything they did in the older <code>org.apache.lucene.analysis</code> bundle except the Chinese analyzer which was moved
	in the above-mentioned 'smartcn' bundle.
	</li>
</ol>

See <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/6_1_0/changes/Changes.html">
Lucene Change Log</a> for details on how the Apache Lucene changed between these versions.
