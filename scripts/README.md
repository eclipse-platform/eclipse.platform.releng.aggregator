# Eclipse build and RelEng scripts

This folder contains scripts that are used in the Eclipse build, mainly for RelEng or Testing tasks.

The contained `Java` classes are intended to be launched as single- or mutli-file _Source-Code Programs_ respectively as plain _Java scripts_.
This means the main source file is launched directly without being compiled and therefore this project must not have any external dependencies except the JDK.
