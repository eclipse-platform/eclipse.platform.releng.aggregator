<h1>Fragment</h1>

<p>A <strong>fragment</strong> is used to replace or extend the functionality of
an existing plug-in.  A common use for fragments is to put environment (operating system,
architecture, etc.) specific code into fragments.  Depending on the environment the 
plug-in is installed in the base plug-in code along with the correct fragment can be installed.
Fragments are also ideal for shipping features like language or maintenance packs that typically 
trail the initial products for a few months.</p>

<p>When a fragment is detected by the platform and its parent plug-in is found, 
the fragment's libraries, extensions and extension points are &quot;merged&quot; with 
those of the parent plug-in. </p>

<p>While this merging mechanism is good from a runtime point of view,
developers need to view fragments as separate entities while working on them.</p>

<p>PDE provides full support for fragment development. Fragments can be viewed as
&quot;limited plug-ins&quot;. They have all of the capability of regular
plug-ins but have no concept of life-cycle. Fragments have no top-level class
with &quot;startup&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot; methods.</p>

<p>To create a fragment use the <a href="../guide/tools/project_wizards/new_fragment_project.htm">New Fragment Project</a>
wizard.  Editing fragments is very similar to editing plug-ins.</p>
