<h1>Extensions and Extension Points</h1>

<p>A basic rule for building modular software systems is to avoid tight 
coupling between components.  If components are tightly integrated,
it becomes difficult to assemble the pieces into
different configurations or to replace a component with a different implementation
without causing a ripple of changes across the system.</p>

<p>Loose coupling in Eclipse is achieved partially through the mechanism 
of <strong>extensions</strong> and <strong>extension points</strong>. 
The simplest metaphor for describing extensions and extension points is electrical 
outlets. The outlet, or socket,
is the extension point; the plug, or light bulb that connects to it, the
extension. As with electric outlets, extension points come in a wide
variety of shapes and sizes, and only the extensions that are designed
for that particular extension point will fit.</p>

<p>When a plug-in wants to allow other plug-ins to extend or customize
portions of its functionality, it will declare an extension
point.  The extension point declares a contract, typically a combination 
of XML markup and Java interfaces, that extensions must conform to.
Plug-ins that want to connect to that extension point must implement
that contract in their extension.  The key attribute is that the plug-in
being extended knows nothing about the plug-in that is connecting to
it beyond the scope of that extension point contract. This allows plug-ins
built by different individuals or companies to interact seamlessly, even
without their knowing much about one another.</p>

<p>The Eclipse Platform has many applications of the extension 
and extension point concept.  Some extensions are entirely
<i>declarative</i>; that is, they contribute no code at all.  For example,
one extension point provides customized key bindings,
and another defines custom file annotations, called <i>markers</i>;
neither of these extension points requires any code on behalf of the extension. 
</p>

<p>Another category of extension points is for overriding the default behavior of 
a component.  For example, the Java development tools include a 
code formatter but also supply an extension point for third-party 
code formatters to be plugged in.  The resources plug-in has an
extension point that allows certain plug-ins to replace the implementation
of basic file operations, such as moving and deletion. </p>

<p>Yet another category
of extension points is used to group related elements in the user
interface.  For example, extension points for providing views,
editors, and wizards to the UI allow the base UI plug-in to group
common features, such as
putting all import wizards into a single dialog,
and to define a consistent way of presenting UI contributions from a wide 
variety of other plug-ins.</p>
