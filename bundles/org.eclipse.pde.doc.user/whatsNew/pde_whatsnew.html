      The API Tools Execution Environment descriptions are now supplied on the Eclipse update sites as a single

    <tr id="noreference-types">
    <td class="title">API Tools allows @noreference Javadoc tag on types</td>
    <td class="content">
      API Tools now allows the use of the <code>@noreference</code> Javadoc tag on types (classes, interfaces,
      annotations and enums).
      <p><img src="images/no-reference.png" alt="Type defining noreference Javadoc tag"/></p>
      <p>Placing this tag restricts the API so that any reference to that type or its members
      will be flagged as invalid API use.</p>
      <p><img src="images/using-no-reference.png" alt="Class trying to reference a type marked as noreference"/></p>
      <p>
      To mark a type in an API package as not being API, tag it as <code>@noreference</code>,
      <code>@noextend</code> and <code>@noinstantiate</code> (or <code>@noimplement</code>).  This ensures that
      no client can access it via valid API and the type could later be removed.

    <td class="title">API Tools Javadoc tags check visibility</td>
    <td class="content">
      A member that is not publicly visible, such as a method or field marked private, is not part 
      of API.  Any API Tools Javadoc tags on it are invalid.  Now, API Tools will also check if a
      member is not visible because of the visibility of an enclosing type.  If the member is not visible,
      any tags on it will be considered invalid.
      <p><img src="images/api-parent-not-visible.png" alt="Javadoc tag flagged as invalid because member is not visible"/></p>
      <p>
      Tag validation is turned off by default.  To turn it on for your API Tools enabled project, open 
      <b>Project Properties > Plug-in Development > API Errors/Warnings</b>.  Set 
      <b>API Use > General > Unsupported use of API Javadoc tags</b> to <code>Warning</code> or <code>Error</code>.

    <td class="title">API Tools has limited support for pre-OSGi Eclipse plug-ins</td>
    <td class="content">
      Eclipse plug-ins created before 3.1 did not contain an OSGi bundle manifest.  API Tools
      can now convert the pre-OSGi plug-ins to valid components in an API baseline.  This allows
      analysis, use and freeze scans to process plug-ins that depend on pre-OSGi plug-ins instead
      of failing to resolve.
      <p><img src="images/use-scan.png" alt="Use scan launch configuration with pre-OSGi plug-ins"/></p>
      <p>
      An OSGi runtime is required to do the conversion.  Tasks run using Eclipse AntRunner
      or the API Use Report external tools launch configuration can convert the plug-ins.  Tasks
      run from the command line Ant runner will skip pre-OSGi plug-ins.

  <tr id="api-unresolved-bundles">
   <td class="title">API Tools Analysis and Freeze tasks can run with unresolved bundles</td>
   <td class="content">
	 The API Tools <b>Analysis</b> and <b>API Freeze</b> Ant tasks will now process bundles
	 with resolver errors such as missing dependencies.  This means you can now get analysis results
	 for an incomplete product.
	 <p>
     The Ant tasks produce reports based on a reference baseline and a profile.  Previously both 
     the baseline and the profile had to describe complete products.  Any bundle that had resolver 
     errors due to missing dependencies would be skipped.  Now these bundles will be processed.
     </p>
     <p>
     Resolver errors can affect the results, therefore a list of resolver errors is included in the XML output
     and warnings are added to the HTML report. To return to the old behavior of skipping
     unresolved bundles, you can set <code>processunresolvedbundles="false"</code> on your Ant task.

      Problem filter files (.api_filter) can be used to filter problems reported by the API Tools analysis
      task and the workspace analysis builder.  These filter files can now be applied to API Tools use scans.
      Reference problems that are filtered out of the analysis results can also be filtered from the results
      of use scans.
      <p>
      Filters are specified in the task using the same property as the analysis task.  Set the <em>filters</em>
      attribute on the <em>apitooling.apiuse</em> task, specifying the root directory of API filter files.  Each
      filter file must be in a folder with a filename matching the component name the filter file applies to.

      Many of the API Tools tasks, including Analysis, API Use, and API Freeze, provide <em>includelist</em> and
      <em>excludelist</em> attributes which can be used to limit the reported problems. Previously,
      if you set an include or exclude list, but the file wasn't found, the task would continue without warning
      about the incorrect filtering.  Now a missing include or exclude list will result in the task failing with
      an explanation.

      can be found in a package exported by a plug-in, a quick fix will be available to add an import
      package entry to your plug-in manifest.  There is also a quick fix to add the exporting plug-in to

      JRE on the <b>Main</b> tab.
      <p>
        To find a valid execution environment, all known environments are checked against each bundle 
        or plug-in that will be launched. Only an execution environment that is valid for all
        plug-ins and bundles will be selected.  If no valid environment is found, a default JRE

      contributor will be queried for additional entries.

      If you are using Equinox Adapter hooks to load additional libraries at runtime you can use this API to add

      to prevent other operations such as builders from running on a stale classpath.
      <p>
      This behaviour can be enabled in 4.2.2 by setting the system property <em>pde.lockWorkspaceForClasspath</em> to
