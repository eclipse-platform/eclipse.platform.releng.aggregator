    <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%"><b>To clean or not to clean</b></td>
    <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">When you create a new runtime 
    workbench launch configuration, PDE presets the Program Arguments on the 
    launch configuration to include a -clean argument.&nbsp;
    <p>This -clean argument clears all runtime-cached data in your runtime 
    workbench from one invocation to the next to ensure that all the changes 
    made in your host workbench, e.g. new Java packages were added to a plug-in 
    project, etc., are picked up when you launch a runtime workbench.</p>
    <p>This clearing of the cache may hinder performance if your target platform 
    contains a large number of plug-ins.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Therefore, if you're in a situation where your target platform has a 
    large number of plug-ins and you're at a stage where you are not actively 
    adding/removing packages from your plug-in projects, you could remove the 
    -clean argument from the launch configuration to improve startup time.</p></td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%"><b>Importing with linking</b></td>
    <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%">Importing external plug-ins and 
    fragments can be time consuming and may result in large workspaces, 
    depending on the content of the plug-ins being imported.&nbsp; Therefore, 
    the 'Import External Plug-ins and Fragments' wizard gives you the option to 
    import with linking.&nbsp; This means that the import operation will not 
    copy the resources being imported into your workspace.&nbsp; It will simply 
    create links to the files being imported.&nbsp; You will be able to browse 
    these linked resources, as if they had been copied into your workspace.&nbsp; 
    However, they are physically not there on your file system, so you will not 
    be able to modify them.&nbsp; Beware of operations that depend on files 
    being physically in your workspace, as they will not work on linked 
    resources.</td>

    <td valign="top" align="left" width="20%" height="112"><b>Templates</b></td>
    <td valign="top" align="left" width="80%" height="112">For a quick start, PDE provides 
    several template plug-ins that will generate a plug-in with one or more 
    fully-working extensions.&nbsp; In addition, if at any point, you would like 
    to add a new extension from the template list (without having to generate a 
    plug-in), you could access these extension templates directly from the 
    manifest editor.&nbsp; From the 'Extensions' page of the editor, click 
    'Add...'.&nbsp; In the wizard that comes up, select Extension Templates in 
    the left pane and choose the template of choice in the right pane.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left" height="280"><b>Plug-in dependency extent</b></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left" height="280">If you have ever looked at the 
    list of plug-ins that your plug-in depends on and wondered why your plug-in 
    needs a particular plug-in X, now you can easily find out why.&nbsp; 
    <p>The <b>Compute Dependency Extent </b>operation
      found on the context menu in several contexts (including manifest file
      Dependencies page and Plug-in Dependencies view) performs a combined Java and
      plug-in search to find all Java types and extension points provided by 
    plug-in X which are referenced
      by your plug-in. The results will be displayed in the Search view.&nbsp; When a type is selected in the Search results view, the <b>References
      in <i>MyPlugIn</i></b> action in the context menu searches for the places
      in the plug-in where the selected type is referenced.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If the 
    search returns 0 results, you should definitely remove plug-in X from your 
    list of dependencies, as it is not being used at all, and it would just slow 
    class loading.</p>
    <p>The <b>Compute Dependency Extent</b> is also useful to check if you are 
    using internal (non-API) classes from plug-in X, which might not be 
    desirable.</p></td>

    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left" height="112"><b>Finding unused dependencies</b></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left" height="112">Minimizing a plug-in's number of 
    dependencies is certain to improve performance.&nbsp; As your plug-in 
    evolves, its list of dependencies might become stale, as it might be still 
    containing references to plug-ins that it no longer needs.&nbsp; A quick way 
    to check that all dependencies listed by your plug-in are actually used by 
    the plug-in is to run the 'Find Unused Dependencies' utility, which is 
    available through the context menu of the 'Dependencies' page of PDE's 
    manifest editor.</td>

    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="left" height="80"><b>Extending the Java 
    search scope</b></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left" height="80">Java Search is limited to projects 
    in your workspace and external jars that these projects reference.&nbsp; If 
    you would like to add more libraries from external plug-ins into the search: 
    open the Plug-ins View, select a plug-in and choose <b>Add to Java Search</b> 
    from the context menu. This is handy for remaining
      aware of other plug-ins that depend on ones you're working on.</td>
