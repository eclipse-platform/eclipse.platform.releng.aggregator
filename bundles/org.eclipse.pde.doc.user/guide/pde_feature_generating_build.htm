<h3>Build configuration</h3>

<p>The feature build mechanism is driven by a build configuration.&nbsp; The
build configuration for an individual plug-in, fragment, or feature is found
in a <b> build.properties</b> file for the corresponding element.</p>

<p>PDE project creation wizards generate the <b> build.properties</b> file when
plug-in projects are created. The file contains information on how to compile source folders into
JARs. This information can be indirectly updated in the Runtime page of the
manifest editor. It can also be directly modified using the appropriate editor.</p>

<p>PDE provides a simple editor for the <b> build.properties</b> that has form and source views.
The file itself follows the Java properties format. You need to provide a number of
keys and their corresponding values. Multiple values are separated using a comma
as the delimiter. </p>

<p>The most important keys to provide are those for mapping of source folders
into run-time libraries. Those drive the build process, control where to
find source code to compile and how to package it into the libraries. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>source.&lt;library&gt;</b> - lists source folders to include for the library (e.g. <b>source.xyz.jar=src/, src-ant/</b>);
  <li><b>bin.includes</b> - lists files to include in the binary build;</li>
  <li><b>bin.excludes</b> - lists files to exclude from the binary build;</li>
  <li><b>src.includes</b> - lists files to include in the source build;</li>
  <li> <b>src.excludes</b> - lists files to exclude from the source build;</li>  
  <li> <b>custom=true</b> - indicates that the build script is hand-crafted as opposed to automatically generated;</li>
  <li> <b>jars.extra.classpath</b> - extra classpaths used to perform automated build. Classpath can either be relative paths, or
	platform urls referring to plug-ins and fragments of your development environment (e.g. <b>../someplugin/xyz.jar</b>, <b>platform:/plugins/org.apache.ant/ant.jar</b>).
	If you use those build files in external build processes, refrains from using platform urls, or complement them 
	with relative paths;</li>
  <li> <b>jars.compile.order</b> - defines order in which jars should be compiled (in case there are multiple libraries);</li>
</ul>
<p> The values
defined for these keys are expressed as Ant "patterns". Standard formats give the expected results.&nbsp; For example, &quot;*<b>.jar</b>&quot; 
indicates all jar files in the top level directory. The patterns are not deep by default.&nbsp; If you want to
describe all Java files for example, you should use the pattern "<b>**/*.java</b>".&nbsp;&nbsp;
The pattern "<b>**</b>" matches any number of directory levels.&nbsp;
Similarly, to describe whole sub-trees, use "<b>xyz/</b>".
