<h1>Creating a plug-in project</h1>
<p>In the workspace, a plug-in is represented by a single project that encapsulates 
  all the code and resources of the plug-in.</p>
<p>To create a plug-in project, bring up the New Plug-in Project creation wizard 
via&nbsp; <b>File &gt; New &gt; Plug-in Project</b>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/project-structure.png" alt="Plug-in Project Structure" ></p>
<p>It is a convention that plug-in project names are the same as plug-in IDs, 
but they can be different. </p>
<p>The plug-in project can be created in one of two flavors: a Java project or a 
simple project.&nbsp; Most plug-ins are meant to contain executable Java code 
and must therefore be housed in a Java project.&nbsp; On the other hand, if, for 
example, you are creating a documentation plug-in, then a simple project will 
suffice.</p>
<p>A plug-in with an OSGi bundle manifest is the recommended plug-in format. In 
  addition to faster startup and classloading, it allows the plug-in to take advantage 
  to many new runtime capabilities.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/default-codegen.png" alt="plug-in content page" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Plug-in Content page, you set the data with which the plugin.xml file 
  will be initialized, including the plug-id, version and name.</p>
<p>The recommended deployed form of a plug-in is to be shipped as a single JAR 
  with all the classes and resources at the root of the JAR. For this format, 
  you may keep the <strong>Classpath</strong> field empty, or enter '.' (without 
  quotes). </p>
<p>The Plug-in class is a top-level Java class that represents the entire plug-in.&nbsp; 
  It will be used at runtime to control the plug-in's life cycle, i.e. its implementation 
  will determine what happens when the plug-in starts up or shuts down.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/project-codegen.png" alt="Plug-in code generators" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next page shows the various templates that PDE provides which generate 
useful content such as views, editors, property pages etc. </p>
<p>In this example, we will create a plug-in with the &quot;Hello, World&quot; 
  template. You can read about the wizard in the area to the right of the wizard 
  list.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Click <b>Next</b>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/hello-world-page.png" alt="&quot;Sample Action Set&quot; template page" ></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The next page will let you customize the sample extension that 
we are creating.</p>
<p align="left">When you press <b>Finish</b>, the wizard will create the new project, 
  all the specified folders and files, and the initial Java build path. The build 
  path is important for correct compilation of Java classes that are generated. 
  The wizard will also open the plug-in manifest editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> After the wizard is
finished, the initial project structure should look like this:</p>
