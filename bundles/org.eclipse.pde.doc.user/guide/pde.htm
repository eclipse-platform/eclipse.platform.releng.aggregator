<h1>Introduction to PDE</h1>
<p>The Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) is a tool that is designed to 
assist developers in the creation, development, testing, debugging, and 
deployment of Eclipse plug-ins.&nbsp; The mandate of PDE also encompasses&nbsp; 
tooling for the development of fragments, features, and update sites.</p>
<p>PDE is part of the Eclipse SDK and not a separately launched
tool.&nbsp; In line with the general Eclipse platform philosophy, PDE provides a 
wide variety of platform contributions (e.g. views, editors, wizards, launchers, 
etc.) that blend transparently with the rest of the Eclipse workbench, and 
assist the developer in every stage of plug-in development while working inside 
the Eclipse workbench.</p>
<p>As a pre-requisite to working with PDE, you need
to understand the concepts presented in the Platform ISV Guide and the JDT User 
Guide.</p>
