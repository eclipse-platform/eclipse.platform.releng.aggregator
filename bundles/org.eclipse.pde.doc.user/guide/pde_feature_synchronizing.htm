<h2>Synchronizing versions</h2>
<h3>UI driven synchronization</h3>
<p>The versions of plug-ins and fragments should be synchronized with the
version of the packaged feature so that you can manage plug-in, fragment, and
feature versions consistently.&nbsp; Developers typically ignore individual
manifest versions until it is time to deploy their features.&nbsp; The Update
Manager uses feature versions to determine whether a plug-in is older or newer
than one already installed.&nbsp; Plug-ins and fragments need to follow the same
version number conventions so there is no confusion about which plug-in version belongs
to which feature version.</p>
<p>The most convenient way to synchronize versions is to pick the version of the
feature and force it into all the plug-ins and fragments that the feature references. This operation updates manifest files, so you are required to close all the manifest editors
before proceeding.</p>
<h4>Example: Synchronizing versions in the feature editor</h4>
<p>We will take our ongoing example and force the feature version (1.2.2) into
&quot;XYZ Plug-in&quot; and &quot;German Fragment.&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the component manifest editor.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Synchronize versions...</b> from the popup menu. A wizard will open.</li>
  <li>Select the first radio button (&quot;Force feature version...&quot;). Press
    <b>Finish</b>.</li>
  <li>Switch to the Content page verify that the versions are now
    1.2.2.</li>
  <li>Double-click on &quot;XYZ Plug-in&quot; and &quot;German Fragment&quot;
    objects and
    verify versions in their corresponding manifest editors.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Automatic synchronization at build time</h3>
If the plug-in version changes frequently and/or developers do not have access to the feature, the versions of plug-ins, fragments and included 
features can be set to the special value <b>0.0.0</b> that will be replaced when exporting the feature. This is especially convenient when plug-in version are automatically 
upgraded using the qualifier tag.
