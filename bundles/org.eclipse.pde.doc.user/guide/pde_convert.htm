<title>Converting projects into PDE projects</title>

<h1>Converting existing projects into PDE projects</h1>
<p>A PDE project is a project that &quot;knows&quot; it hosts a plug-in and is 
eligible for plug-in-specific operations. </p>
<p>PDE is fully capable of working on plug-ins in the workspace represented as
ordinary projects. However, it cannot offer incremental file checking,
capability-based filtering and other similar features if a project does not
possess full PDE capabilities.</p>
<p>It is
possible to convert a regular project into a PDE project at any point. For
example, you may have some Java classes that you want to package into a library
and share with others as a plug-in. Alternatively, you may want to get full
support for manifest syntax checking and reporting that only PDE projects have.</p>
<p>To convert projects into PDE projects, select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Other...</b> and
select <b>Convert Projects to Plug-in Projects</b> wizard from the <b>Plug-in 
Development</b> category.&nbsp; Click <b>Next</b>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/convert-java.png" alt="&quot;Convert Existing Projects&quot; wizard" ></p>
<p>The wizard will list all projects that do not have PDE capability.
Candidate projects do not need to have manifest files. If they are missing, PDE
will create generic ones you can use as a starting point. Files that already
exist will be left intact. As an option, you can re-compute the build path in
the process. If your project has a classpath you want preserved, deselect this 
checkbox.</p>
