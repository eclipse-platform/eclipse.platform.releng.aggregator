<h3>Generating ANT scripts</h3>

<p> <b> Ant</b> is a simple open-source scripting engine that is capable of running
scripts written in XML format. Ant is ideal for executing tasks usually found in
automated builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The variables set in the plug-in, fragment or feature <b>build.properties
</b> will be used by automated build scripts for
Ant.&nbsp; PDE generates Ant scripts for creating
individual plug-in and fragment build files and one overall script for building
the feature JAR. This &quot;main&quot; script is also responsible for running individual
script files in the right order (defined by the plug-in dependency chain). Each
build file has the same name (<b>build.xml</b>) and is created as a sibling of the manifest
files in the corresponding projects.</p>

<p>Since Ant scripts use the replacement variables in <b>build.properties</b>, you can typically use them &quot;as is,&quot; without
modifying the generated scripts. If you do modify them, you must not recreate the
scripts every time you want to rebuild the component. For this reason, script
generation and execution can be individually controlled. </p>

<p>To create scripts, you can simply press the button <b>Package...</b> in
the feature manifest. If the manifest is not open, you can select the
manifest file and select <b>Create Feature JAR</b> from the popup menu (similar
command exists for plug-in and fragment manifests). The command will generate
the build script and open Ant wizard to execute it:</p>

<p align="left">The standard Ant wizard allows customization in two ways: by
providing the execution arguments and by selecting one or more build targets.</p>

<p align="left">Ant arguments are typically used to provide property values that
override default values and control the build process. Arguments are set using
&quot;-Dproperty=value&quot;. The following properties are recognized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>bootclasspath</b> - if set, it replaces the default boot
    classpath. Used when compiling cross-platform plug-ins (e.g. building a UI
    plug-in for Windows using Linux)</li>
  <li><b>build.compiler</font> </b>- sets
    what compiler should be used. The default is the JDT compiler.</li>
  <li><b>build.result.folder</b></font> - where
    the temporary files for the update JAR creation should be placed.
    These files are usually the plug-in library JARs.</font></li>
  <li><b>plugin.destination</b> - where
    plug-in and fragment's update JARs should be put. These JARs represent
    entire plug-ins and fragments in format suitable for publishing on an
    Install/Update server and referencing by a feature. The typical layout of an
    Update site is to have all the plug-in and fragment JARs in one place and
    all the feature in another. This argument is useful to place plug-ins and
    fragment directly into the desired directory (or the staging place on the
    local machine before pushing the features onto the remote server).</li>
  <li><b>feature.destination</b> - where
    feature's update JARs should be put.</li>
</ul>
<p>When executing feature build script, the
following targets are used to call individual targets of plug-ins or fragments
that are listed in the feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>all.plugins</b> - to build all the
    listed plug-ins</li>
  <li><b>all.fragments</b> - to build all the
    listed fragments</li>
  <li><b>all.children</b> - to build all the
    listed plug-ins and fragments</li>
</ul>
<p>The following targets build JARs and sources
for all feature children:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>build.jars</b></li>
  <li><b>build.sources</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Target <b>build.update.jar</b> can be selected
to generate a feature JAR in the format used by the install/update mechanism.
The above mentioned property <b>feature.destination</b> can be used to define
where to put the JAR and <b>plugin.destination</b> controls where to put
individual update JARs for plug-ins and fragments.</p>
<p>Target <b>zip.distribution</b> creates a zip
file with the feature and its plug-ins and fragments in an SDK-like structure
but does not include source code. Source can be generated with the <b>zip.sources</b>
target.</p>
<p>Use <b>clean</b> target to delete everything
produced by running any of the targets. Finally, the <b>refresh</b> target
performs a &quot;Refresh&quot; action in the current project, thus making the
newly generated resources visible in the Navigator or Package Explorer.</p>
<p>When executing build scripts for individual
plug-ins and fragments, an additional target called zip.plugin can be used. It
creates a zip file with the binary and source contents of a plug-in with the
following structure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>id_version/<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where 'id' is the plug-in unique identifier
and 'version' is the plug-in version. This zip file can be directly unzipped
into the Eclipse installation directory as a form of a quick manual deployment.</p>
