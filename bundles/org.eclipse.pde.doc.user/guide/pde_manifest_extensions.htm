<h2>Extensions page</h2>
<p>The Extensions page is used to browse and edit plug-in extensions. Extensions are the
central mechanism for contributing behavior to the platform. Unless your plug-in is a
simple Java API library made available to other plug-ins, new behavior is contributed as an extension.</p>
<p>Plug-ins contribute to the extension points defined by those plug-ins that
they require.&nbsp; Your extension syntax must match the extension point
definition in order to be processed correctly. The total list of eligible
extension points is computed by PDE by traversing all the visible plug-ins (both
workspace and external).</p>
<p>The generic extension wizard provided by PDE will simply scan the extension points.&nbsp;
If an extension schema is provided (see <a href="pde_schema.htm">Extension Point
Schema</a>), then the wizard will extract grammar and extension point meta
data from the schema.</p>
<p>In addition to the generic wizard, a number of extension templates are
available. These are the same templates that can be used to generate initial
content of the plug-in project. Their presence here allows you to stage the
extension creation. You can create a plug-in with a simple view, then add an
editor or a wizard later.</p>
<h3>Example:&nbsp; Adding an Action Sets extension</h3>
<p>To illustrate the operation of the Extensions page, we will add a 'Hello, PDE world'
action to our plug-in. We will be contributing to the <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_actionSets.html"><b>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</b></a>
 extension point.&nbsp; This example assumes you are already familiar with the
extension point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> We will start by pressing the <b>Add...</b> button to select the
extension wizard:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/new-extension.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Extension Wizard Selection"></p>
<p align="left">The <b>Schema-based Extension</b> wizard is the default since it handles
extensions in the most generic ways. It will scan the plug-ins and offer all the
extension points found, with or without schemas. Those with schemas will allow
PDE to offer better assistance. If an extension point schema is missing, PDE will
let you add elements and attributes to the extension, but it will not be able to verify if they are
valid for the selected extension point.</p>
<p align="left">When you press <b>Next</b>, a list of extension points will be
offered. Select <b>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</b> and press <b>Finish</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/extension-list.jpg" width="500" height="593" alt="Schema-based wizard - extension point selection"></p>
<p align="left">The wizard will add the new extension to the list of extensions.
Since this
extension has a schema associated with it, we can further edit our extension definition.
We select the newly added extension and choose <b>New-&gt;actionSet</b> from the
popup menu. This XML
element has been defined as the only valid element that can show up in the
extension definition.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">For all required attributes, PDE will create default values.&nbsp;
We can change the default name of the action set to &quot;Sample Action Set&quot; by selecting the element and changing the
<b>label</b>
property in the Properties view. The new name will show up in
the extension list.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/actionSet-1.jpg" width="545" height="506" alt="Extensions editor page"></p>
<p align="left">We now need to define a menu and an action for the action set.
If we select the action set and popup the menu in the &quot;Extension Element Children&quot;
section, the &quot;New&quot; menu will offer two choices:&nbsp; menu and
action.&nbsp; These choices are based on the schema information for the action
sets extension.&nbsp; First, we create the menu.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Select <b>New-&gt;menu </b>to create the menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Select it and change its properties.&nbsp; Change the <b> id</b> to &quot;sampleMenu&quot; and its
    <b>label</b> to &quot;Sample Menu.&quot;</li>
  <li>
    While the menu object is still selected, popup a menu and
    select <b>New-&gt;separator</b>. A new child should appear.</li>
  <li>
    Select &quot;separator&quot; and change its <b> name</b> into &quot;sampleGroup&quot;.
    This will create a named group in the menu that we can use to contribute our
    action.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">We can create the action in a similar way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Select <b>New-&gt;action</b> to create an
    action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Select it and change its properties.&nbsp; Change its <b>label</b>
    to &quot;&amp;Sample Action&quot; and its <b> menubarPath</b> to &quot;sampleMenu/sampleGroup.&quot;&nbsp;
    This will add the action to the menu that we just defined.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The last thing we need to set is the action's Java class. The
extension point definition specifies that an action must implement&nbsp; <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate.html"><b>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</b></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
PDE can offer assistance since it knows this information from the schema:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Click on the <b>class</b> property to put it into edit mode.
    Select the button to open the cell editor dialog.</li>
  <li>
    Select the radio button to create a new class.</li>
  <li>
    Click on the <b>Browse</b> button to choose the source container
    and choose &quot;XYZ Plugin&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    Change the name of the class to be &quot;SampleAction.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Before you press <b>Finish</b>, the dialog should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/actionSet-2.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Java Attribute Editor"></p>
<p align="left">When you finish, the new class will be
generated based on the required interface (with a stub implementation for each
abstract method). In addition, the name of the new class will be set for the class property value. The wizard will
also open the new Java class for editing by default. You can locate the &quot;run&quot; method and add the following
statement:</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   System.out.println(&quot;Hello, PDE world!&quot;);
</pre></font>
<p align="left">Save the new source code and close the Java editor.&nbsp; Then
return to the Extensions page of the
manifest editor and save.</p>
<p align="left">We will continue with this example when we <a href="pde_running.htm">run
the plug-in</a>.</p>
