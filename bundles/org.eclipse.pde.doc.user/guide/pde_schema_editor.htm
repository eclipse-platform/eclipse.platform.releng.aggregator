<h2>Extension point schema editor</h2>
<p>You can open the extension point schema editor in two ways: as a by-product of
creating a new extension point or by opening an existing extension point
schema.&nbsp; By
convention, new schemas have the same name as the extension point id with a <b>.exsd</b> file extension. They are placed in
<b>schema</b> directory in your plug-in directory tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a new extension point is created in the PDE, the initial schema file will also be
created and the schema editor will be opened for editing. You can define the schema
right away, or close it and do it later. Making a complete
extension point schema allows PDE to offer automated assistance to the users
of your extension point.</p>
<p>The PDE schema editor is based on the same concepts as the plug-in manifest
editor.&nbsp; It has two form pages and one source page.&nbsp; Since XML schema is verbose and
can be hard
to read in its source form, you should use the form pages for most of the
editing.&nbsp; The source page is useful for reading the resulting source code.</p>
<h3>Example: Creating schema for the &quot;Sample Parsers&quot; extension point</h3>
<p>We previously created the &quot;Sample Parsers&quot; extension point and the
initial schema. We can now open the schema by going into the <b>schema</b>
folder of our project and double-clicking on the <b>parsers.exsd</b> file.&nbsp;
This will open the schema editor.</p>
<p>We want to do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define the valid XML elements and attributes for the extension point.</li>
  <li>Define the grammar (content model).</li>
  <li>Provide documentation snippets that will be merged into a reference
    document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every extension point schema starts with a declaration of the
&quot;extension&quot;
element.&nbsp; We will add a new XML element called &quot;parser.&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press the button <b>New Element</b> in the <b>Extension Points Elements</b>
    section.</li>
  <li>Move to the Properties view and change its name from &quot;New_Element&quot;
    to &quot;parser&quot;</li>
  <li>While the new element is still selected, press the <b>New Attribute</b>
    button. This will create &quot;new_attribute&quot; as its child. Change its <b>
    name</b> to &quot;id&quot; and <b>use</b> to &quot;required&quot; in the property sheet.</li>
  <li>While still in the property sheet, press the button &quot;Clone this
    attribute&quot; available on the local tool bar. This will create a copy of
    the attribute.&nbsp; This is useful because it allows us to quickly define all the
    attributes without leaving the property sheet.</li>
  <li>Change the name of the new attribute into &quot;name.&quot;</li>
  <li>Clone the attribute again. This time, change the name to &quot;class.&quot;&nbsp; This attribute will be used to represent a fully
    qualified name of the Java class that must implement a specific Java
    interface. We need to specify this so that PDE can later take advantage of
    it. Change <b>kind</b> from &quot;string&quot; to &quot;java.&quot;&nbsp;
    Set the <b>basedOn</b> property
    to <b>com.example.xyz.IParser</b>.&nbsp; (This interface does not exist yet, but we will
    make it later.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, the schema editor should look like this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/schema-1.png" alt="Extension point schema editor - Definition page" ></p>
<p align="left">We will now add an additional attribute that takes values from
a discrete list of choices.&nbsp; This means we need to create an enumeration restriction of
the base <b>string</b>  type.&nbsp; In addition, we will set a default value for the
attribute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    While the &quot;parser&quot; element is selected, press&nbsp;
    the <b>New Attribute</b>
    button. Change its name in the property sheet to &quot;mode.&quot;</li>
  <li>
    Click in the value cell of the &quot;restriction&quot; property
    to bring the restriction dialog up.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Change the restriction type from &quot;none&quot; to
    &quot;enumeration.&quot;</li>
  <li>
    Add the following three choices: &quot;never,&quot; &quot;always,&quot;
    and &quot;manual.&quot;&nbsp; (These are our three hypothetical modes for
    the parser extension.)</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The restriction dialog should look like
this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/restriction-dialog.png" alt="Type restriction dialog" ></p>
<p align="left">When the dialog is closed, change the &quot;use&quot; attribute to
&quot;default&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attribute to &quot;always.&quot;&nbsp;
This establishes the default value.&nbsp; Note that the status line shows an error message as you are typing the value,
since it restricts valid values to the three enumeration choices. Once you
finish typing, the error message should go away because &quot;always&quot; is a
valid value.</p>
<p align="left">Now that we have defined all of the elements and attributes, we need to
define grammar. Our goal is to define that the &quot;extension&quot; element can have any
number of &quot;parser&quot; elements as children.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Select the &quot;extension&quot; element. Its initial content model shows
    an empty sequence compositor.</li>
  <li>
    Select the sequence compositor and select <b>New-&gt;Reference-&gt;parser</b>
    from the popup menu. This will add the parser reference to
    the sequence compositor.</li>
  <li>
    The default cardinality of references is [1,1] which means
    that there can be exactly one &quot;parser&quot; element. That is not quite what we
    wanted. We select the &quot;parser&quot; reference and change the <b>maxOccurs</b> to &quot;unbounded.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">After defining the grammar, the DTD approximation
below the grammar section shows what the grammar for the selected element would
look like in DTD.&nbsp; This information is provided to help
developers who are still more comfortable with DTDs than XML schemas.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/schema-2.png" alt="Extension point schema editor - element grammar" ></p>
<p align="left">Now that we have defined valid elements, attributes and grammar,
we need to provide some information about the extension point. There are two
types of schema
documentation snippets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Documentation about elements and attributes</li>
  <li>
    Documentation about the extension point usage, API, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The first snippet type is provided in the Definition page of
the schema manifest. As you select elements and attributes, you can add short
text about them in the &quot;Description&quot; section. The expected format is raw HTML (as
with Javadoc) and the text will be copied as-is into the final reference
document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Select the &quot;id&quot; attribute of the
    &quot;parser&quot; element and type the
    following in the Description editor:<br>
    a unique name that will be used to
    reference this parser.</li>
  <li>
    Select the &quot;name&quot; attribute and
    add the following text:<b><br>
    </b>
    a translatable name that will be used for presenting this parser in the UI.</li>
  <li>
    Select the &quot;class&quot; attribute and
    add the following text (note the HTML tags):<b><br>
    </b>
    a fully qualified name of the Java class that implements &lt;samp&gt;com.example.xyz.IParser&lt;/samp&gt;
    interface.</li>
  <li>
    Select the &quot;mode&quot; attribute and
    add the following:<b><br>
    </b>
    an optional flag that indicates how often this parser instance will run
    (default is &lt;samp&gt;always&lt;/samp&gt;).</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">We now have to provide a short text description of the extension point
itself. In order to do that, we switch to the Documentation page:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You should now be on the &quot;Overview&quot; tab.
    In the text editor and add the following text:<br>
    <p style="color:#4444CC; position:relative; left:25px">
    This extension point is used to plug in
    additional parsers. 
    The parsers actually do not work - we have just used
    them as an example of extension point schema.<br>
    </p>
    Press <b>Apply</b>.</li>
  <li>
    Click on the  &quot;Examples&quot; tab and add the following text:<br>
<p style="color:#4444CC; position:relative; left:25px">
The following is an example of the extension point usage:
<font color="#4444CC"><pre>
   &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;pre&gt;
      &lt;extension point=&quot;com.example.xyz.parsers&quot;&gt;
         &lt;parser
            id=&quot;com.example.xyz.parser1&quot;
            name=&quot;Sample Parser 1&quot;
            class=&quot;com.example.xyz.SampleParser1&quot;&gt;
         &lt;/parser&gt;
      &lt;/extension&gt;
   &lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</p>
    <p>Press <b>Apply</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select the &quot;API Information&quot; tab and add the following text:<br>
  <p style="color:#4444CC; position:relative; left:25px">
    Plug-ins that want to extend this extension point must implement &lt;samp&gt;com.example.xyz.IParser&lt;/samp&gt;
    interface.<br>
  </p>
    Press <b>Apply</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the &quot;Supplied Implementation&quot; tab and add the following text:<b><br>
    </b>
    <p style="color:#4444CC; position:relative; left:25px">
    XYZ Plugin provides default implementation of the parser.
    </p>
    Press <b>Apply</b>.<i>
    <br>
    </i></li>
</ol>
<blockquote><i>Note: Special consideration has to be taken when providing examples.
Normally, PDE would treat the provided text as raw HTML and would not respect new
line and white space greater than one character (i.e. ignorable white space). This
is to be expected when regular text is concerned, but is extremely annoying when
providing examples, where tabbing and vertical alignment is significant if the
example is to look good. PDE has a compromise for this situation: if it detects
the HTML tag &lt;pre&gt;, it will take the content as-is (preserving all characters
without modification) until closing tag &lt;/pre&gt; is seen. This is why we can
provide an example like the above and be confident that it will look good in the final
reference document.</i></blockquote>
<p>You may have already noticed that as you type documentation, more and more
elements in the editor Outline view acquire a &quot;pen&quot; image overlay. This little
indicator tells you that the element in question has some text associated with
it - a quick way to check if the documentation is missing somewhere in the
document.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/schema-outline.png" alt="Extension point schema editor outline"></p>
<p>Once we have finished with the documentation, we can take a look at the
reference documentation. You can do it in two ways. All the time during your 
work, you can preview the reference document by selecting Preview Reference 
Document item from the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can set up PDE 
preferences (Preferences&gt;Plug-in Development&gt;Compilers, under Schema tab) to 
automatically create reference documentation on each schema file change. 
Regardless of the method to create it, the resulting document for
this example would look like <a href="parsers.htm">this</a>.</p>
