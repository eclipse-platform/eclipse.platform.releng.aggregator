<h1>Plug-in Development Environment Overview</h1>
<p>The Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) is a tool that is designed to 
assist developers in the creation, development, testing, debugging, and 
deployment of Eclipse plug-ins.&nbsp; The mandate of PDE also encompasses&nbsp; 
tooling for the development of fragments, features, and update sites.</p>
<p>PDE is part of the Eclipse SDK and not a separately launched
tool.&nbsp; In line with the general Eclipse platform philosophy, PDE provides a 
wide variety of platform contributions (e.g. views, editors, wizards, launchers, 
etc.) that blend transparently with the rest of the Eclipse workbench, and 
assist the developer in every stage of plug-in development while working inside 
the Eclipse workbench.</p>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Host vs. runtime</b><br>
	When you start up the workbench, you will use it to work on your projects 
	that define the plug-ins you are building.&nbsp;The workbench&nbsp;instance that you 
	are running as you develop your plug-in using the PDE and other tools is the
	<b>host</b> instance. The features available in this instance will come exclusively from 
	the plug-ins that are installed with your application. Once you are happy 
	with your plug-in and want to test it, you can launch another workbench 
	instance, the <b>runtime</b> instance. This instance will contain the same plug-ins as the host instance, 
	but will also have the plug-ins you were working on in the host instance. 
	PDE launcher will take care of&nbsp;merging your plug-ins with the host plug-ins 
	and creating the run-time instance.</li>
	<li><b>External vs. workspace plug-ins</b><br>
	When developing Eclipse plug-ins, the set of plug-ins that you will be used 
	to run the runtime workbench come from two distinct places: the workspace of 
	the host instance and the target platform.&nbsp; Although, to PDE, all plug-ins 
	are the same no matter where they come from, there are a few differences 
	that quickly become evident to users:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
		<li><b>Workspace plug-ins</b> are those plug-ins under development in 
		your host workbench.&nbsp; They are under your control and can be added, 
		deleted and modified by the user. </li>
		<li><b>External plug-ins</b> are plug-ins that arrived with the basic 
		platform installation and are simply referenced from their original 
		location without modification. You can reference them, browse them, view 
		their source and debug them, but they are read-only.&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The Plug-ins view, which is part of the PDE perspective, will show the 
combined list of workspace and external plug-ins. In it, you will be able to 
browse the directory structure of external plug-ins, open files, etc.</p>
