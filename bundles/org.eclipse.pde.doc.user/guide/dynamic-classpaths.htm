<h2>PDE Dynamic Classpaths FAQ</h2>
<p>Dynamic Classpaths is the way PDE computes the build path for plug-in 
projects in Eclipse 3.0. </p>
<p><b>Q: What is classpath stability?<br>
A:</b> Classpath stability is a measure of classpath change with respect to the 
self-hosting choice made by a developer. Ideally, classpaths should not change 
regardless of the complement of source projects in the workspace. Binary project 
self-hosting offers good classpath stability, where all classpaths contain only 
project references. External plug-in self-hosting provides less stable 
classpaths. They are still stable with respect to the local install location of 
the external libraries, but the list of plug-ins as source projects must remain 
constant for all the members of a team in order to share them via a repository.</p>
<p>Since 2.0, added plug-in version to the plug-in location on the file system 
further reduced the classpath stability when external plug-ins were used.</p>
<p><b>Q: If binary projects offer better classpath stability, why not use them 
all the time?<br>
A: </b>Self-hosting using imported binary projects is a good choice as long the 
number of imported plug-ins is reasonably small (a few dozen). For large 
products with hundreds of plug-ins, a wholesale import is not an option. 
Typically, their developers self-host with a few source projects, a few dozen 
directly related binary projects, and everything else as external plug-ins. From 
the purely theoretical point of view, it seems strange to waste time and 
resources to import dozens and dozens of external plug-ins to be able to compile 
a few source projects.</p>
<p><b>Q: I think that (binary projects/external plug-ins) self-hosting method is 
better. What is wrong with my team using it if we do it together?<br>
A:</b> Static classpaths (either using binary projects or external plug-ins) 
cast in stone your self-hosting method of choice and force everybody else to use 
it as well.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are dynamic classpaths?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> <b>Dynamic classpaths </b>is a PDE feature whereby a portion of the 
plug-in project classpath that is related to plug-in dependencies is computed 
dynamically using JDT classpath container technology. The resolution of the dynamic classpaths is performed 'just in 
time' and is always up to date with the conditions in your workspace. 
Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the classpath resolution allows PDE to adapt 
to changes and always have the correct classpath regardless of your method of 
self-hosting.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the classpath stability of dynamic classpaths?<br>
A:</b> Ultimate. Since all the entries for the required plug-ins are replaced 
with one classpath container entry, your classpath is always the same.</p>
<p><b>Q: How can dynamic classpaths help me?</b><br>
<b>A: </b>With dynamic classpaths, there is no need to make upfront decisions 
with respect to the self-hosting style. If binary projects are present, dynamic 
classpaths will resolve to project references. If not, they will resolve to 
external plug-in JARs. As binary projects are added or removed, dynamic classpaths will track the changes and adapt. You will not need to update your 
classpath ever again. In addition, other teams that want to take one or more of 
your projects from CVS and get them to compile don't have to use your personal 
self-hosting style to do so.</p>
<p><b>Q: Since PDE Core is resolving the dynamic classpaths, does it mean that I 
will be dependent on PDE to do the right thing?<br>
A: </b>In a word, yes. Being dynamic, your classpath will always be computed on 
the fly, not hard-coded in the .classpath file (that was the whole idea, 
right?). But consider this: PDE has a sophisticated algorithm for computing the 
classpath that strives to get you as close as possible to the run-time 
conditions. What the JDT compiler 'sees' at development time should be as close 
as possible to what class loaders will see at run time. PDE Core is more capable 
of keeping your classpath up to date than yourself most of the time. If you need 
to manually tweak the classpath in order to compile, something is most likely 
wrong with your setup and there is a strong chance your plug-in will not run 
correctly (SWT team being an exception).</p>
<p><b>Q: My team uses binary projects for self-hosting exclusively. Will I lose 
anything by switching to dynamic classpaths?<br>
A:</b> No. Dynamic classpaths do not dictate your personal choice of self-hosting 
arrangements. It simply resolves your plug-in dependencies in the given context. 
If you continue to import external plug-ins as binary projects, dynamic 
classpaths will resolve to project references as before.</p>
<p><b>Q: What do I need to activate dynamic classpaths?<br>
A: </b>Update the classpaths 
of all your 2.1 plug-ins just once. You will notice that classpaths are now shorter and all 
the dependent plug-in references are now replaced with one container entry. You 
can continue to work. Make sure to check the source projects into the 
repository, including the changed .classpath files.</p>
<p><b>Q: I have extra classpath entries so that I can compile my Ant tasks/servlets/JSPs.<br>
A:</b> As part of the classpath computation, PDE takes 'jars.extra.classpath' 
property from build.properties file into account. If you are set up correctly 
for building, PDE will generate the correct classpath.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I manipulate the dynamically computed classpath entries?<br>
A:</b> In the unlikely event you need to manipulate your dynamic classpath 
entries, you can do so from Properties&gt;Java Build Path&gt;Libraries tab. Expand the 
'Plug-in Dependencies' node and manipulate the entries there.</p>
<p><b>Q: Some of the computed entries for libraries don't have source 
attachments. Can I add them manually?<br>
A:</b> PDE computes source attachments for most of the libraries. There are some 
odd cases where automatic source attachments may fail due to source zips not 
following naming conventions. You can attach sources manually for these entries 
in the build path properties dialog.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will my manual source attachments be wiped out the next time PDE 
computes the classpath dynamically?<br>
A: </b>No. PDE keeps track of these manual cases and reapplies them after 
dynamic computation as long as the library paths didn't change.</p>
<p><b>Q: I am an SWT developer. Can I use dynamic classpaths?<br>
A: </b>Sadly, no. SWT team has a unique self-hosting setup whereby classpaths for 
various environments are saved in the repository and renamed into .classpath in 
the project depending on the platform they are working on. They will have to 
continue to use their self-hosting methods.</p>
