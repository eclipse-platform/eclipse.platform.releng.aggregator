<h2>Update site editor</h2>
<p>The update site editor uses the same concepts seen in the other PDE editors. 
However, it is different from these editors in that it has an additional page 
that controls how plug-ins, fragments and features in other projects within the 
workspace are build and placed in the update site project's folders. </p>
<p>Update site editor opens on site.xml file that is created by the update site 
creation wizard. This file represents the site map and defines what will be made 
available to Eclipse update manager when connecting to the update site.</p>
<p>The editor has three pages that deal strictly with the file content:
(Description, Features and Archives) and a Source page that shows you raw XML code of the
site map.</p>
