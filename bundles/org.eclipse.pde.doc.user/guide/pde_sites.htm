<h2>Working with update sites</h2>
<p>Eclipse is capable of installing or updating features placed on the remote 
servers. The features and plug-ins must be packaged in JARs and have a manifest 
(site.xml) file that links them together. These files collectively form an Eclipse <b>
update site</b>.</p>
<p>PDE provides support for building update sites directly in the workspace. 
Normally, update sites are placed on remote HTTP servers, but sites in the local 
file systems are also valid and can be viewed in update manager. PDE uses this 
property to provide for building and previewing update sites directly in the 
workspace.</p>
