<h2>Running with tracing</h2>
<p>The platform provides a mechanism for tracking the activity of your plug-in at runtime
without full debugging. It allows you to use tracing flags that will cause
tracing information to be printed on the standard output (or Console view). These flags are defined in files named
&quot;<b>.options</b>&quot; and have the following syntax:</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>   &lt;plug-in Id&gt;/debug = true/false  (master switch)
   &lt;plug-in Id&gt;/&lt;tracing flag&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
</pre></font>
<p>The first entry represents master switch for tracing your plug-in. If you
call the method <b>isDebugging</b> in your plug-in class, it will
return true if the value of this tracing variable is true. Other tracing flags
are defined by you and their value can be obtained by using</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>   Platform.getDebugOption(optionName);
</pre></font>
<p>Most of the platform plug-ins define tracing flags, particularly the platform
core. For a
new plug-in developer, the most interesting set of tracing flags are those
related to class loading, because they can allow tracing of plug-in loading
problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Example:&nbsp; Adding tracing support to your plug-in</h2>
<p align="left">If you add tracing support to the plug-in under development, 
your plug-ins will appear in the list of plug-ins that support tracing.</p>
<p>In order to allow other developers to control your plug-in's tracing flags,
you need to make these options known.&nbsp; This is typically done by placing a <b>.options</b> 
file in your plug-in.&nbsp; The file lists all the supported flags as well as 
their default values. </p>
<p>We will now define a template <b> .options</b> file with a
few tracing flags for our new plug-in.</p>
<p>Select the <b>com.example.xyz</b> project created earlier and create a new file
.<b>options</b>. When
the default text editor opens, add the following entries:</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>   com.example.xyz/debug = true
   com.example.xyz/debug/flag = true
   com.example.xyz/debug/filter = *
</pre></font>
<p>When this file is saved, select <b>Run &gt; Run...</b> to open the launch
dialog. Our
plug-in should now show up in the list. When selected,
it should show the newly defined flags with their default values.</p>
<p align="center">

<p>Creating the <b>.options</b> file only defines the availability flags,
allowing other plug-in developers to define the values of the tracing
properties.&nbsp; You will still need to check the values of your tracing
properties in your plug-in code using <b>Platform.getDebugOption()</b><b>.</b></p>
