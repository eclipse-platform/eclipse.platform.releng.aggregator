<h1>Fragments</h1>
<p>A plug-in <b> fragment</b> is used to provide additional plug-in 
functionality to an existing plug-in after it has been installed. Fragments are 
ideal for shipping features like language or maintenance packs that typically 
trail the initial products for a few months.&nbsp;Another frequent use of fragments 
is to deliver OS or windowing system-specific features. </p>
<p>When a fragment is detected by the platform and its parent plug-in is found, 
the fragment's libraries, extensions and extension points are &quot;merged&quot; with 
those of the parent plug-in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While this merging mechanism is good from a runtime point of view,
developers need to view
fragments as separate entities while working on them. Fragment development is
often done by different teams, on a different schedule, sometimes even on
different operating systems from the original plug-in.</p>
<p>PDE provides full support for fragment development. Fragments can be viewed as
&quot;limited plug-ins&quot;.&nbsp; They have all of the capability of regular
plug-ins but have no concept of life-cycle. Fragments have no top-level class
with &quot;startup&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot; methods.</p>
