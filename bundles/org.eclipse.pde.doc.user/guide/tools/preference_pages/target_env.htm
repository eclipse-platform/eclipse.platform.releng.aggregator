<h1>Target Environment</h1>
<p>The <strong>Target Environment</strong> tab defines the operating system, windowing system, architecture and locale for which you are developing your plug-ins.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/preferences/target_environment.png" alt="Target Environment" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Typically, a plug-in is agnostic to its environment and should run in all environments. However, if you have platform-specific resources or code, it is recommended to package them in a plug-in fragment that declares the platform with which it is compatible.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>org.eclipse.ui.win32</em> fragment has the following filter in its <em>MANIFEST.MF</em>: </p>
<p><strong>Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (ws=win32)</strong></p>
<p>This filter indicates that the <em>org.eclipse.ui.win32</em> fragment is designed to run only on platforms with a <em>win32</em> windowing system. If a user attempts to run Eclipse on a platform that does not meet this requirement, the fragment will be silently ignored by the runtime. </p>
