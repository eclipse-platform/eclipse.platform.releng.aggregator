<h2>General Settings</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt before overwriting build.xml files while exporting</strong> - 
When selected, a dialog will be opened before deleting your build.xml files when an export operation starts.
</p>

<p><strong>Update stale manifest files prior to launching</strong> - 
This option only affects manifest files using automated management of dependencies.  Prior to launching, the manifest files will be updated with any necessary dependency changes.  This option is off by default as it decreases launch performance.
</p>

<p><strong>Prompt before deleting a target definition file</strong> - 
When selected, a dialog will be opened before deleting a target definition file when a target definition is removed from the <a href="target_platform.htm">Target Platform</a> preference page.
</p>

<p><strong>Include all plug-ins from target in Java search</strong> - 
When selected, all the plug-ins from the active target platform will be added to the Java search scope.  Adding plug-ins to the java search scope will allow the plug-in contents to show up when doing Java searches and using the Open Type Dialog.  When this option is on, if any plug-in is removed from Java search, the preference will be turned off.
</p>  

<h2>Plug-in presentation</h2>
<p>By default, whenever a plug-in or a feature is presented in the UI (i.e. in the outline view, Plug-ins view, editors, etc.), the label shows the plug-in or feature ID followed by the plug-in or feature version. </p>
<p>The <strong>Plug-in presentation</strong> preference is a global setting that allows you to show an alternate label for plug-ins and features composed of the (translated) name of the plug-in or feature followed by the plug-in or feature version. Source plug-in are filtered from views by default.  Selecting <strong>Show source plug-ins</strong> will make them visible in the UI.</p>
  
<h2>Workspace location for new Eclipse Application launch configurations</h2>
<p>When a new Eclipse Application launch configuration is created a workspace location is chosen for you.  This preference allows a different default setting to be chosen.  Selecting <strong>Use as workspace location</strong> will make whatever is written the default location.  If <strong>Append launch configuration name to this location</strong> is selected the launch configuration name will be appended to the location.</p>

<h2>Workspace location for new JUnit Plug-in Test launch configurations</h2>
<p>When a new JUnit Plug-in Test launch configuration is created a workspace location is chosen for you.  This preference allows a different default setting to be chosen.  Selecting <strong>Use as workspace location</strong> will make whatever is written the default location.  If <strong>Append launch configuration name to this location</strong> is selected the launch configuration name will be appended to the location.</p>
