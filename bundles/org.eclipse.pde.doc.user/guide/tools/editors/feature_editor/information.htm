<h1>Feature Information</h1>
<p>The main purpose of the <strong>Feature Information</strong> page is to specify information that is required by <em>Update Manager</em> to install the feature. </p>

<h2>Feature Description</h2>
<p>A <strong>Feature Description</strong> is a brief component description. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_description.png" alt="Description"></p>
<p>Typically, a description is plain text and intended to be translated. Alternatively, you can provide the description in HTML format and point to it via a URL. The URL can be specified as   absolute or relative. If a relative URL is specified, it is assumed to be relative to (and packaged   in) the feature archive. </p>

<h2>Copyright Notice </h2>
<p>The feature <strong>Copyright Notice</strong> is typically provided as plain text and is intended to be translated. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_copyright.png" alt="Copyright"></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can provide the copyright notice in HTML format and point to it via a URL. The URL can be specified as   absolute or relative. If a relative URL is specified, it is assumed to be relative to (and packaged   in) the feature archive. </p>

<h2>License Agreement</h2>
<p>The <strong>License Agreement</strong> is a feature <em>click-through</em> license. It is typically  simple text and is intended to be translated. </p>
<p>The license is   displayed in a standard dialog with <strong>Accept</strong> and <strong>Reject</strong> actions during the   download and installation process. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_license.png" alt="License"></p>
<p>Note that a <em>click-through</em> license must be   specified for any feature that will be selected for installation or update using   the <em>Update Manager</em>. When using nested features, only the nesting parent   (i.e. the feature selected for installation or update) must have <em>click-through</em> license <strong>Text</strong> defined. </p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that the license text is required even if the Optional URL attribute is specified. </strong></em></p>

<h2>Sites to Visit</h2>
<p><strong>Sites to Visit</strong> specify the name and URL of sites to search for new features. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_sites.png" alt="Sites To Visit"></p>
<p>In general, a vendor can use <strong>Sites to Visit</strong> to reference its own site(s), or partner site(s) that offer complementary features. </p>
<p>Eclipse uses this data simply as a way to distribute new site URLs to the clients. Sites that belong to   root features (at the top of the hierarchy) typically appear as <strong>Sites to Visit</strong>   in <em>Update Manager</em>. </p>
