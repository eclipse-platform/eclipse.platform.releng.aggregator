<h1>Included Plug-ins</h1>
<p>The <strong>Plug-ins and Fragments</strong> page lists all the plug-ins and fragments that should be packaged in the feature and specifies their properties.</p>

<h2>Plug-in List </h2>
<p>The <strong>Plug-ins and Fragments</strong> list enumerates all the plug-ins and fragments that are included directly in the feature. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/plugins.png" alt="Plug-ins" ></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Add...</strong> button to browse the list of available plug-ins to add to the list.</p>
<p>The preferred versioning scheme for referenced plug-ins is to give them a <strong>0.0.0</strong> version. This is a special value that   will be replaced by the actual plug-in version when the feature is exported. This option is especially convenient when   plug-in versions contain a <em>qualifier</em> segment. </p>

<h2>Plug-in Details </h2>
<p><strong>Plug-in Details</strong> are used as guidelines by <em>Update Manager</em> to determine what, when and how to install the plug-ins included by a feature. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/plugins_details.png" alt="Plug-in Details" ></p>
<p>The <strong>Download Size</strong> and <strong>Installation Size</strong> are optional hints specified to allow <em>Update Manager</em> to provide useful user feedback about the feature being installed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Unpack the plug-in archive after installation</strong> option determines whether a plug-in is to be unpacked (i.e. flattened) or left in a JAR after installation.</p>
<p>If a plug-in or fragment contains platform-specific code, then environment   conditions should be specified and associated with that plug-in or fragment.</p>
