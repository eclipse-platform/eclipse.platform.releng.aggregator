<h1>Plug-in Build</h1>
<p>The <strong>Build </strong>page contains all the information needed to   build, package and export the plug-in. Although it appears as a page in the plug-in   manifest editor, changes made to it are written by PDE to the plug-in's <em>build.properties</em> file.  The <em>build.properties</em> file solely guides the build   process.</p>

<h2>Custom Build</h2>
<p>The <strong>Custom Build</strong> option prevents the build.xml file from being overwritten with a generated build file.  Use this option when 
the plug-in provides a custom build.xml that is being manually updated.</p>

<h2>Runtime Information</h2>
<p>The <strong>Runtime Information</strong> section lists all the libraries that you want to build. For each library, you must list the source folder(s) that will be   compiled into the library. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/runtime.png" alt="Runtime" ></p>
<p>If your plug-in declares more than one library, order them   correctly using the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> button.  This will ensure that they get compiled in the correct   order.</p>

<h2>Binary and Source Builds </h2>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/binary_source.png" alt="Binary and Source Builds"></p>

<p>The <strong>Binary Build</strong> section is where you select all the files and folders that will make it into the packaged plug-in.</p>
<p>The <strong>Source Build </strong>section has a specialized purpose and is   not commonly used or needed by the general population. It is only needed when you need to ship source in separate plug-ins and features rather than in binary plug-ins. See the <code>org.eclipse.pde.core.source</code> extension point for details.</p>

<h2>Extra Classpath Entries </h2>
<p>If you need extra libraries on the build path for   your source code to compile, you can add these required JARs in the <strong>Extra Classpath   Entries</strong> section. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/classpath.png" alt="Extra Classpath"></p>
<p>Please note that this section should be used to add libraries that are not required to be on the plug-in runtime classpath. </p>
