<h1>Product Configuration</h1>
<p>The <strong>Configuration</strong> page defines start level information for the product and the configuration file needed to run the product. </p>

<h2>Start Levels</h2>
<p>In the start level section, you can list plug-ins to be automatically started or started with a specific start level.</p>

<h2>Configuration File </h2>
<p>Upon startup, the runtime reads a configuration file named <EM>config.ini</EM> located in a <EM>configuration/</EM> subdirectory of the   configuration area of an Eclipse product. This file is a standard properties file that can configure many aspects of the runtime.   For a full list of the supported properties, refer to the <A href="../../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">Eclipse   runtime options</A> document.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/configuration_file.png" alt="Configuration File" ></p>
<p>The <STRONG>Generate a default config.ini file </STRONG>is the   default option and is recommended unless you have some very specific needs. When   this option is selected, PDE generates a <EM>config.ini</EM> file with the   following properties:</p>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>osgi.bundles</STRONG> - lists all the bundles that should be   installed and optionally started once the system is up and running. This list is   based on the <EM>osgi.bundles</EM> key found in the <EM>${target_home}/configuration/config.ini</EM> file. (Note, the ${target_home}   variable is the location of the target platform).</li>   
  <LI><STRONG>osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel</STRONG> - denotes the default OSGi   start level at which a bundle should start. The default value is set to <STRONG>4.</STRONG></li>
  <LI><STRONG>eclipse.product</STRONG> - specifies the ID of the product to launch. </LI>
  <li><STRONG>osgi.splashPath</STRONG> - specifies one or more locations of the   splash screen. </LI>
</UL>
<p>You also have the option to <strong>use an existing config.ini file</strong> which will be copied by PDE to your final product as-is.</p>
