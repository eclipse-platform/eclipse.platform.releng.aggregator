<p class="style1">Plug-ins Tab</p>
<p>When testing your plug-in, you have the ability to manage and hand-select the list of plug-ins that you want to launch with on the <strong>Plug-ins Tab</strong> of the launch configuration. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/launchers/launcher_junit_plugins.png" alt="JUnit Plug-ins Tab" hspace="30"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Launch Options </p>
<p>The <strong>Launch with</strong> combo allows you to configure the way the JUnit Plug-in Test is launched. The options are explained in more detail below.</p>
<p>The <strong>all workspace and enabled external plug-ins</strong> option is the default setting. With this option, the plug-ins that constitute the runtime Eclipse application you are launching are all the workspace plug-ins and all the plug-ins that are explicitly checked on the <strong>Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; Plug-in Development &gt; Target Platform</strong> preference page. This option requires very little maintenance; since, your list of plug-ins is maintained by PDE and updated prior to every launch as you create or delete plug-ins in the workspace. This option is recommended when the <strong>Program to Run</strong> setting on the <a href="junit_main.htm">Main tab</a> of the launch configuration is set to the <strong>default product</strong> or <strong>default application</strong> of your target. </p>
<p>The <strong>plug-ins selected below only</strong> option is typically used when you are in <strong>headless</strong> mode or when you are testing an RCP application that uses a subset of the plug-ins from the workspace and target. This setting requires more maintenance than the other two options; since, you have to make sure the list of selected plug-ins is up-to-date when you add or remove a plug-in from the workspace. There are several buttons available to help you select plug-ins including an <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button.  The <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button should be used often to ensure the subset of plug-ins you have selected is complete. </p>
<p>Please note that if a workspace plug-in has the same ID as a target plug-in, the workspace plug-in overrides its target counterpart. This behavior can be overridden when using the second option; since, you can deselect a workspace plug-in and select its target counterpart. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Validate Plug-ins</p>
<p>The <strong>Validate Plug-ins</strong> functionality, which can be invoked via the button located at the bottom right corner of the <strong>Plug-ins tab</strong>, analyzes the selected set of plug-ins to find launching startup problems. For instance, missing dependencies, unsatisfied execution environments, incompatible platform filters are a few of the potential problems that may prevent your plug-in from running.</p>
<p>By checking the <strong>Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching</strong> option, PDE runs the <strong>Validate Plug-ins</strong> function prior to every launch. If problems are found, a dialog showing the error comes up for you to examine and you have the option to continue the launch without correcting the problems or canceling the launch to rectify the issues. Otherwise, if no problems are found, the launch proceeds as normal. </p>
