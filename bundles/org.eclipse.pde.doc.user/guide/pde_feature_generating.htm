<h2>Deploying a Feature</h2>

<p>Once versions are synchronized, we can package our feature in the format fit 
for publishing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>First you have to set up the build configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; The build 
configuration includes information about the files and directories that should 
be included in the feature for each individual plug-in and fragment.&nbsp; There 
may be some design-time files and directories that should not be shipped.&nbsp; 
See <a href="pde_feature_generating_build.htm">Build Configuration</a> for 
details.</p>

Then you can use PDE's Export Deployable Features wizard to build and export the 
feature.&nbsp; This way you are shielded from Ant scripts and your workspace is 
never polluted with build by-products.<ol>
  <li>Select <b>File&gt;Export...&gt;Deployable Features</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the feature(s) you want to export.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/feature-export.gif" alt="Export Features wizard" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wizard will build all the features selected and their included plug-ins 
and fragments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the 'single deployable zip file' option is selected, everything will go 
into one zip file, which can then be unzipped into any Eclipse product.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the 'update JAR archives' option is selected, the wizard will create a JAR 
for every feature selected.&nbsp; The JAR name will be of the format: <b>&lt;feature_id&gt;_&lt;feature_version&gt;.jar</b>, 
and will be placed in a <b>features/</b> sub-directory of the directory you 
specified in the wizard.&nbsp; The wizard will also create a JAR for every 
plug-in or fragment included in the feature.&nbsp; The JAR name will be of the 
format <b>&lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt;</b>.jar, and will be placed in a <b>plug-ins/ </b>
sub-directory of the directory you specified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alternative would be to build features manually:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the feature.xml file for your feature project and choose '<b>Create 
  Ant Build File</b>'.&nbsp; This will generate a build.xml file.</li>
  <li>Select the build.xml file and choose '<b>Run Ant...</b>'&nbsp; </li>
  <li>In the Ant build script wizard, select the target(s) you want to run.&nbsp; 
  See <a href="pde_feature_generating_ant.htm">Generating Ant Scripts</a> for 
  details.</li>
</ol>
