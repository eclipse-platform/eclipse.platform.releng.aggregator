<h1>Eclipse 3.8 Plug-in Migration FAQ</h1>

<h2><a name="illegalAmbiguousVarargs">Why does my varargs code which was legal in 3.7 and earlier no longer compile with 3.8 (Juno)?</a></h2>
<p>
JDK 6 and below had a bug because of which the following code was considered legal:</p>
<pre>
public class VarargPrimitiveTest {
    public static void test(int... a) {
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
    }

    public static &lt;T&gt; void test(Object... a) {
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(1);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>However, this bug was fixed in JDK 7 and the above code now reports an ambiguous invocation error at the call site for test(..).
This was thereby fixed for Eclipse Juno via bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=346038">346038</a> across all
compliance levels. This is why the above code will no longer compile with Juno.</p>

<p>If you still want the above code to compile in compliance &lt; 1.7, to mimic JDK 6 or below, you can use the
system property <b>tolerateIllegalAmbiguousVarargsInvocation</b> to force Eclipse to tolerate the ambiguous varargs cases
such as above. This property can be set in the eclipse.ini file after the -vmargs setting as shown below:</p>
<pre>
...
-vmargs
-DtolerateIllegalAmbiguousVarargsInvocation=true
...
</pre>
<p>Note that with this setting, Eclipse Juno does not only mimic JDK 6 and below in letting the above code compile, but also
mimics JDK 6 and below in raising an error in cases such as below, even though they're legal in both JDK 7 and in Eclipse Juno when
the tolerateIllegalAmbiguousVarargsInvocation is disabled:</p>
<pre>
class Test {
        public static void foo(int ...i) {}
        public static void foo(double...d) {}

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            foo(1, 2, 3);     // foo flagged ambiguous
        }
}
</pre>
