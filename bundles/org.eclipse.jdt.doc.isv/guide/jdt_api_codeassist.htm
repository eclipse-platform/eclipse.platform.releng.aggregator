Performing code assist on Java code</H2>
<P>
The JDT API allows other plug-ins to perform code assist or code select on some Java elements. 
Elements that allow this manipulation should implement <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICodeAssist.html"> ICodeAssist</a></b>.&nbsp;
<P>
There are two kinds of manipulation:
<ul>
<li>Code completion - compute the completion of a Java token.</li>
<li>Code selection - answer the Java element indicated by the selected text of a
  given offset and length.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the Java model there are two elements that implement this interface: <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/IClassFile.html"> IClassFile</a></b> and <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICompilationUnit.html"> ICompilationUnit</a></b>.&nbsp;
Code completion and code selection only answer results for a class file if it has attached source.</p>
<H3>
Code completion</h3>

<H4>
Performing a code completion
</h4>
<P>
The only way to programmatically perform code completion is to invoke <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICodeAssist.html#codeComplete(int, org.eclipse.jdt.core.ICompletionRequestor)">ICodeAssist.codeComplete</a></b>.
You specify the offset in the compilation unit after which the code completion
is desired.&nbsp; You must also supply an instance of <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICompletionRequestor.html"> ICompletionRequestor</a></b> to accept the possible completions.</P>

<P>Each method in <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICompletionRequestor.html"> ICompletionRequestor</a>
</b>accepts a different kind of proposal for code completion.&nbsp; The
parameters of each method include text that describes the proposed element (its
name, declaring type, etc.), its proposed position for insertion in the
compilation unit, and its relevance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P>A completion requestor can accept many different types
of completions including the insertion of the following elements:</P>

<ul>
  <li>anonymous types</li>
  <li>classes</li>
  <li>fields</li>
  <li>interfaces</li>
  <li>keywords</li>
  <li>labels</li>
  <li>local variables</li>
  <li>method call</li>
  <li>method declaration</li>
  <li>modifier</li>
  <li>package import or reference</li>
  <li>type</li>
  <li>variable name</li>
</ul>
<p>The completion requestor must also be able to accept compilation
errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your plug-in is not interested in every kind of code completion, a <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/CompletionRequestorAdapter.html">CompletionRequestorAdapter</a></b>
can be used so that you need only implement the kinds of completions you are
interested in.&nbsp; The following example shows an adapter that is only used to
accept class completions.</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   // Get the compilation unit
   ICompilationUnit unit = ...;
   
   // Get the offset
   int offset = ...;
   
   // Create the requestor
   ICompletionRequestor requestor = new CompletionRequestorAdapter() {
      public void acceptClass(
         char[] packageName,
         char[] className,
         char[] completionName,
         int modifiers,
         int completionStart,
         int completionEnd,
         int relevance) {
         System.out.println(&quot;propose a class named &quot; + new String(className));
      }
   };
   
   // Compute proposals
   unit.codeComplete(offset, requestor);</font>
</pre><h4>Completion relevance
</h4>

<p>Because there may be many different possible completions, the notion of
relevance is used to compare the relevance of a suggested completion to other
proposals.&nbsp; Relevance is represented by a positive integer.&nbsp; The value
has no implicit meaning except to be used relative to the value for other
proposals.&nbsp; The relevance of a code completion candidate can be affected by
the expected type of the expression, as it relates to the types in the
surrounding code, such as variable types, cast types, return types, etc.&nbsp;
The presence of an expected prefix or suffix in a completion also affects its
relevance.
</p>

<H4>
Code completion options
</h4>

<P>
The JDT Core plug-in defines options that control the behavior of code
completion.&nbsp; These options can be changed by other plug-ins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<ul>
<li>Activate Visibility Sensitive Completion<br>
  When this option is active, code completion will not answer elements that are
  not visible in the current context.&nbsp; (For example, it will not answer
  private methods of a super class.)</li>
<li>Automatic Qualification of Implicit Members<br>
  When this option is active, completion automatically qualifies completion on implicit field references and message expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional options allow you to specify prefixes and suffixes for the
proposed completion names for fields, static fields, local variables, and method
arguments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> See&nbsp;<a href="jdt_api_options.htm##codeassist"> JDT Core Code Assist
Options</a>
for more information about the code assist options and their defaults.</p>

<H3>
Code selection</h3>

<H4>
Performing a code selection
</h4>
<P>Code selection is used to find the Java element represented by a range of
text (typically the selected text) in a compilation unit.&nbsp; To programmatically perform code selection,
you must invoke <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/ICodeAssist.html#codeSelect(int, int)">ICodeAssist.codeSelect</a></b>.
You must supply the starting index location of the selection and its
length.&nbsp; The result is an array of Java elements.&nbsp; Most of the time there is only one element in the array, but if the selection is ambiguous then all the possible elements are returned.<P>In
the following example, code select is invoked for a compilation unit.

<font color='#4444CC'><pre>   // Get the compilation unit
   ICompilationUnit unit = ...;
   
   // Get the offset and length
   int offset = ...;
   int length = ...;
   
   // perform selection
   IJavaElement[] elements = unit.codeSelect(offset, length);
   System.out.println(&quot;the selected element is &quot; + element[0].getElementName());
</pre></font>

<H4>
Selection at cursor location
</h4>
<P>
When the selection length is specified as 0, a selection will be computed by
finding the complete token that encloses the specified offset.&nbsp; Consider
the following example method:</P>

<P>

<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void fooMethod(Object) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
</P>

</code>
If you specify an offset after the first character of <i>fooMethod</i>, and you
specify a length of 0,&nbsp; then the selection will be computed to include the
entire token <i>fooMethod</i>. If instead, you specify a length of 5, the
selection will considered as <i>ooMet</i>.
