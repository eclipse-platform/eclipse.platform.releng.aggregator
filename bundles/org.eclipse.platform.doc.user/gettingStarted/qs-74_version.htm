<h3>Versioning a project</h3>
<p> Now that the project is complete it is time to version
it. While committing the file resources the repository automatically
assigned them version numbers, or to be more accurate "revision
numbers". As the files were committed the only information supplied was
a commit comment.</p>
<p>To version a project proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="Steps">Select the project <em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em>.
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">In one of the navigation views select <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Tag as Version...</em>
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">When the Tag Resources dialog opens enter the version name <em>A1</em> and click <em class="UILabel">OK</em>.
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">Select the CVS Repositories view.</li>
  <li class="Steps">Expand <b>Versions</b>, and <em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em>. 
    Observe that under <em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em> there is now a version of this project 
    whose version number is <em>A1</em>. Looking closely at the contents of <em class="FileName">folder1</em> note 
    that the version numbers of the individual files match the version numbers 
    in the Workbench.
  </li>
</ol>
