<h3>Ant buildfiles as project builders</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Our second practical example of using Ant buildfiles in Eclipse 
  is a 'project builder'. This is an Ant buildfile that has been designated to 
  run whenever a project is built. The uses for such a buildfile are many:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Generate a .jar file containing class files from your project</li>
  <li>Perform some type of pre or post build processing on source or binary files 
    in your project. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-processing source files to instrument them for performance analysis</li>
      <li>Obfuscating binary files to prevent reverse engineering</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Copy class files to some location (for instance, on a network)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, we will create an Ant buildfile that creates a .jar archive 
  of the class files in a project. Note that this is similar to the example in 
  the last chapter, in which we used an Ant buildfile to generate .jar files for 
  an Eclipse plug-in. This example differs in that it works for any Eclipse project, 
  whether or not it is also an Eclipse plug-in. </p>
