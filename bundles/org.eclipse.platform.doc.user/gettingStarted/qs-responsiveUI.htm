<h1> Responsive UI</h1>
<P CLASS="Para">By default all Eclipse operations run in the user interface thread. 
  Employing the Responsive UI, which allows the threading of sequential code, 
  will enable you to continue working elsewhere in Eclipse. Without the Responsive 
  UI support you would be locked out of performing any other actions when met 
  with a slow operation.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">While some operations automatically run in the background (such 
  as auto build), in many cases a dialog will be displayed providing you with 
  the option to run an operation in the background. For example, building a project 
  manually can sometimes take more than a few minutes, during which time you may 
  wish to continue to use other functions in Eclipse.</p> 
<P CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/res.png" alt="Image of the Build All Menu Item." border="0" > </p>
<p>While the project is being built, select <strong>Run in Background </strong>from 
  the <strong>Building Workspace</strong> dialog and the Responsive UI will allow 
  you to carry on with other tasks in Eclipse.</p>
<p><img src="../images/res_build.png" alt="Image of the Building Workspace window" border="0" ></p>
<p>For information on the status of the action and additional operations that 
  are currently running, click <strong>Details</strong>.
  The <strong>Details </strong>panel displays the status information of the operation 
  at hand as well as any additional operations that may be running simultaneously.</P>
<p><img src="../images/res_otherjobs.png" alt="Image of the Building Workspace window with the Details showing simultaneous operations" border="0" ></P>
<p>The Progress Information dialog also indicates when one operation is being 
  blocked by another. </P>
<p><img src="../images/res_blocked.png" alt="Image of Progress Information view with an operation that is waiting for another to complete." border="0" ></P>
<p>Information about operations that are currently running in the background may also be
accessed at any time using the <strong>Progress View</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/res_details.png" alt="Image of the Progress View showing the Building Workspace operation running" border="0" ></p>
<p>To have operations running in the background set as the default, select <strong>Window 
  &gt; Preferences &gt; General </strong> and check <strong>Always run in background.</strong>
