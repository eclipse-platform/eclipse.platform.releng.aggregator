Rearranging views</h1>
<p CLASS="Head"> The position of the Project Explorer (or any other) view in the Workbench window can 
  be changed.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head"> Click in the title bar of the Project Explorer view and drag the 
      view across the Workbench window. Do not release the mouse button yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head"> While still dragging the view around on the Workbench 
      window, note that various drop outlines appear. These drop outlines
      indicate where the view will dock in relation to the view or editor 
      area underneath the cursor when the mouse button is released.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Dock the Project Explorer in the stack with the Outline view and 
      notice the results of this action. Note the drop outline next to the tab of
      the view you are dropping next to.</P>

      </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click and drag the Project Explorer's title bar to re-dock the view as its
    own view stack on top of the Outline view. Note the drop outline showing the orientation of the views
    after the drop.

  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click and drag the Project Explorer's title bar outside the Workbench window to make it a 
    "detached" window (a view stack in its own window). Note the drop outline showing it will be outside the main workbench window.

    <P CLASS="Para"> Finally, drag the Project Explorer view over the editor area. A 
      drop outline will be displayed to show the view orientation related to the editor area.
