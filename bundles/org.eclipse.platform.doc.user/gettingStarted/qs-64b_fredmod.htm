<h3>Another user making changes</h3>
<p>Now that Fred has the project in his Workbench he needs
to modify several of the files and synchronize with the repository in
order to commit them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fred will make changes to <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> and <em class="FileName">file2.txt</em></li>
  <li>Fred will synchronize and commit his outgoing changes to the two files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fred should proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="Steps">Modify <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> as follows
    <div class="FileContentsDescription">Original contents:
    <pre class="FileContents">
This is the contents
of file 1.
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="FileContentsDescription">New contents (changes shown in bold):
    <pre class="FileContents">
This is the contents
<b>Fred-update</b>
of file 1.
    </pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">Modify <em class="FileName">file2.txt</em> as follows
     <div class="FileContentsDescription">Original contents:
     <pre class="FileContents">
File2 is a small file
with simple text.
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="FileContentsDescription">New contents (changes shown in bold):
       <pre class="FileContents">
File2 is a (<b>Fred was here)</b> small file
with simple text.
    </pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">Observe that the Project Explorer updates the CVS state of a resource.
     Notice that the two files which Fred has changed are preceded by "&gt;".

  </li>
  <li class="Steps">To commit his changes to the repository Fred can either:
    <ul>
      <li>Select the two files and choose 
          <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</em> or,</li>
      <li>Select the project and choose 
          <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Often choosing the project is the easiest thing to do. Let's do
that. Select the project and choose <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Synchronize with
Repository</em> from its context menu. When you are asked to switch to
the Team Synchronizing perspective select 
<em class="UILabel">Yes</em>.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">When the Synchronize View opens Fred can browse the changes he
made and at the end should commit his changes to
<em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> and <em class="FileName">file2.txt</em> by selecting 
<em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em> in the
Synchronize View and from the context menu select 
<em class="UILabel">Commit</em>. You will have to enter a
commit comment before committing the changes.
  </li>
