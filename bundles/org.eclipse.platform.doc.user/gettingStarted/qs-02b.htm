Editors and views</h2>
<P CLASS="Intro">Prior to commencing the Workbench tutorials found in this section, 
  it is important to first be familiar with the various elements of the Workbench. 
  A Workbench consists of: 
<ul>
  <li>
    perspectives</li>
  <li>
    views</li>
  <li>
    editors</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="Intro">A perspective is a group of views and editors in 
the Workbench window. One or more perspectives can exist in a single Workbench 
window. Each perspective contains one or more views and editors. Within a
window, each perspective may have a different set of views but all perspectives
share the same set of editors.</p>
<p CLASS="Intro">A view is a visual component within the Workbench. It is typically 
  used to navigate a hierarchy of information (such as the resources in the Workbench), 
  open an editor, or display properties for the active editor. Modifications made 
  in a view are saved immediately. Only one instance of a particular view type 
  may exist within a Workbench window.&nbsp; </p>
<p CLASS="Intro">An editor is also a visual component within the Workbench. It is typically used to edit or browse a
resource.  Modifications made in an editor follow an open-save-close lifecycle model.
Multiple instances of an editor type may exist within a Workbench window.&nbsp;
</p>
<p CLASS="Intro">Editors and views can be active or inactive, but only one view or editor can be active at any one time.&nbsp;
The active editor or view is the one whose title bar is highlighted. The active part is the
target for common operations like cut, copy and paste. The active part also
determines the contents of the status line. If an editor tab
is white it indicates the editor is not active, however views may show
information based on the last active editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p CLASS="Intro">The Navigator view becomes active when the view is clicked. </p>

<P CLASS="Intro">The outline's tab turns blue, when the outline page is clicked 
  and the Navigator's title bar is no longer blue. The outline page is now active.
