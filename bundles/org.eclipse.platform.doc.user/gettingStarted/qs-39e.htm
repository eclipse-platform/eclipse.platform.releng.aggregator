Tiling editors</h3>
<P CLASS="Para"> The Workbench allows for the creation of two or more sets of 
  editors in the editor area. The editor area can also be resized but views cannot 
  be dragged into the editor area.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Open at least two editors in the editor area by double-clicking 
      editable files in one of the navigation views.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click and drag one of the editor's tabs out of the editor 
      area. Do not release the mouse button.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that the restricted cursor displays if an attempt 
      is made to drop the editor either on top of any view or outside the Workbench 
      window.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Still holding down the mouse button, drag the editor over 
      the editor area and move the cursor along all four edges as well as in the 
      middle of the editor area, on top of another open editor. Notice that along 
      the edges of the editor area the directional arrow drop cursors appear, 
      and in the middle of the editor area the stack drop cursor appears.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Dock the editor on a directional arrow drop cursor so that 
      two editors appear in the editor area.&nbsp;</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that each editor can also be resized as well as the 
      entire editor area to accommodate the editors and views as necessary.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para"> It is important to observe the color of an editor tab (in 
      the figure below there are two groups, one above the other)</p> 
    <p CLASS="Para"><b>blue</b> - indicates that the editor is currently active</p>
    <p CLASS="Para"><b>default </b>(gray on Windows XP) - indicates that the editor 
      was the last active editor. If there is an active view, it will be the editor 
      that the active view is currently working with. This is important when working 
      with views like the Outline and Properties that work closely with the editor.</p></li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Drag and dock the editor somewhere else in the editor area, 
      noting the behavior that results from docking on each kind of drop cursor. 
      Continue to experiment with docking and resizing editors and views until 
      the Workbench has been arranged to satisfaction. The figure below illustrates 
      the layout if one editor is dragged and dropped below another.</P>
