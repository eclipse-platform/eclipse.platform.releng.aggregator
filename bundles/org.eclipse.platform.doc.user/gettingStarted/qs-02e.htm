Views</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">Views support editors and provide alternative presentations or 
  navigations of the information in the Workbench.&nbsp; For example:</P>
<UL CLASS="UnorderedList">
<LI CLASS="Item">
The Bookmarks view displays all bookmarks in the Workbench along with the names
of the files with which the bookmarks are associated.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="Item"> The Navigator view displays the projects and other resources.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Para">
A view might appear by itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<blockquote>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="Para"> To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook simply click 
  its tab. The Workbench provides a number of quick and easy ways to configure 
  an environment, including whether the tabs are at the bottom or top of the notebooks.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" align="center">
<img src="../images/Image3_tabbed.png"  alt="Two views with tabs, navigator view active" border="0"></P>
<P CLASS="Para">Views have two menus, the first, which is accessed by right clicking on the
  view's tab, allows the view to be manipulated in much the 
  same manner as the menu associated with the Workbench window.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" align="center"><img src="../images/Image8_view.png"  alt="Navigator view menu, top left" border="0"></P>
<P CLASS="Para">The second menu, called the "view pull-down menu", is accessed by clicking the down arrow <img src="../images/Image9_viewdownarrow.png" alt="View down arrow" border="0" >. 
  The view pull-down menu typically contains operations that apply to the entire 
  contents of the view, but not to a specific item shown in the view. Operations 
  for sorting and filtering are commonly found on the view pull-down.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" align="center"><img src="../images/Image7_view_pulldown.png"  alt="Navigator view menu, arrow pulldown" border="0"></P>
<P CLASS="Para">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> Customizing the Workbench is a good opportunity to use the <b>Window 
  &gt; Reset Perspective</b> menu operation. The reset operation restores the 
  layout to its original state.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> A view can be displayed by selecting it from the <b>Window &gt; 
  Show View</b> menu. A perspective determines which views may be required and 
  displays these on the <b>Show View</b> submenu. Additional views are available 
  by choosing <b>Other...</b> at the bottom of the <b>Show View</b> submenu. This 
  is just one of the many features that provide for the creation of a custom work 
  environment. </P>
