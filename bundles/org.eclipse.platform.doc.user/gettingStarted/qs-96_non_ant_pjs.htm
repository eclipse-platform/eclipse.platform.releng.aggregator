<h3>Non-Ant project builders</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para"> When we worked through our project builder example, you may have 
  noticed that when we created our project builder Ant buildfile, we had a choice 
  of external tool type:<br>
  <img src="../images/Image614_et_type_dialog.png" alt="Choice of external tool type dialog" border="0" > </P>
<P CLASS="Para">The <b>Program</b> option is essentially a catch-all, allowing you 
  to define an external tool for any executable file that is accessible on your 
  local or network file system. Suppose that instead of Ant, you prefer to use 
  your own shell scripts or Windows .bat files to jar up and deploy your Eclipse 
  projects. You would then create a Program external tool that specified where 
  and how to execute your script. </P>
<ol>
  <li>Create a script that performs your preferred deployment steps.</li>
  <li>Select the project that you wish to build in the Navigator, and choose <b>Properties</b> 
    from the context menu.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Builders</b>, click <b>New...</b>, select <b>Program</b> and click 
    <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>The External Tools dialog appears, configured for Program type tools.</li>
  <li>Enter the location of your script, its working directory, and any required 
    arguments. <br>
    <img src="../images/Image615_program_builder.png" alt="External tools dialog for program type tools" border="0" > 
  </li>
  <li>In this case, the script is a Windows .bat file, but it could be a Linux 
    shell script, a Perl script or just about anything else that can be executed 
    on your system. </li>
  <li>The <b>Refresh</b> and <b>Build Options</b> tabs are identical to the tabs we saw for 
    Ant project builders. In particular, the <b>Build Options</b> tab allows us to control 
    what types of builds trigger our project builder buildfile.</li>
  <li>Apply the changes, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>As with Ant project builders, we can control the ordering of this project 
    builder with respect to other project builders (such as the default Java Builder 
    for Java projects).</li>
  <li>Rebuild your project. This will trigger your script to execute. Any output 
    it generates will be sent to the Console view.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ant is a popular tool for configuring and deploying projects. But if you prefer 
  some other tool, or prefer to do it yourself, you can set up a Program external 
  tool project builder. This allows you customize the deployment of your project 
  as you see fit, while keeping the convenience of automatically running your 
  script every time your project is built.</p>
