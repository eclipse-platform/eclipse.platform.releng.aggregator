Working with another user</h2>
<P>Instructions were given explaining how to create a project and commit it to 
  the repository. First a repository location was specified. Next the project 
  was shared with that location and the HEAD branch. Then the project was synchronized 
  to open the Synchronize view. Finally the resources were committed using the 
  Synchronize view. </P>
<P>The repository currently contains the project and the three files that were 
  committed (file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt). </P>


<P>It's time to find that coworker (let's call him Fred) to work through some 
  steps with you. This section will demonstrate how two people can work on the 
  same project and simultaneously commit changes to the repository. Specifically, 
  the following actions will be taken: </P>

<ul>
  <li>Fred will add the project to his Workbench</li>
  <li>Fred will make changes to file1.txt and file2.txt</li>
  <li>You will simultaneously make changes to file2.txt and file3.txt</li>
  <li>Fred will synchronize and commit his (outgoing) changes to the two files.</li>
  <li>You will synchronize to commit your changes at which time you
    will discover there are outgoing (file3.txt), incoming (file1.txt) and
    conflicts (file2.txt).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
