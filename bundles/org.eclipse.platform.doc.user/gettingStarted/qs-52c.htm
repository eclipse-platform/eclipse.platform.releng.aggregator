Simple compare</h3>
<p CLASS="Head"> In one of the navigation views select file1.txt and file2.txt 
  choose <b>Compare With &gt; Each Other</b> from the context menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head"> A dialog will appear indicating that the two files are the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head"><img src="../images/Image80_compare.png" alt="Compare popup" border="0" ></p>
<p CLASS="Head">Edit file1.txt as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    delete&nbsp; line 1&nbsp; &quot;<i>This is line 1.&quot;</i></li>
  <li>
    change line 3 to be &quot;This is a much better line
    3.&quot;</li>
  <li>
    insert a line 4a (before line 5) that reads &quot;This is
    line 4a and it is new&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="Head">The file (file1.txt) should now read as follows:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>This is line 2.<br>
  This is a much better line 3.<br>
  This is line 4.<br>
  This is line 4a and it is new<br>
  This is line 5.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Save the contents of the file by choosing <b>File &gt; Save</b> (or pressing
Ctrl+S).</p>
<p>To compare the files, once again select file1.txt and file2.txt and choose 
  <b>Compare With &gt; Each Other</b> in the navigation view context menu.</p>
<p>A special compare editor opens. The next section will explain how to use this 
  compare editor.</p>
