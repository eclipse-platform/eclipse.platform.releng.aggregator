<H1 CLASS="Head"> Team CVS tutorial</H1>
<P>This chapter will explain how to use the CVS team capabilities built into the 
  Workbench. The steps in this chapter are team oriented; it will be difficult 
  to complete these tutorials if others are not simultaneously working through 
  this chapter. </P>


<P>Instructions will be given explaining how to work on a project and then commit 
  changes to the repository for others on the team to use. By continuing to work 
  on the project alongside other users, this section will demonstrate how to commit 
  resources that other users may be simultaneously working on, and how to update 
  a workspace with changes others make in the project. </P>
<P>Remember, before getting started, entice at least one coworker into working 
  through these steps as well. </P>
