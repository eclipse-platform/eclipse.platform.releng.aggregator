<h3>Executing project builders</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">The whole point of project builders is that they are not explicitly 
  run by the user, but instead are run any time a qualifying build takes place 
  for the project that owns the buildfile. Remember that the builders are triggered as indicated
  on the <strong>Build Options</strong> tab in the External Tools dialog and can be 
  any combination of after a clean, during a manual build or during auto builds. Let's see how this works.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select the HW project in the Navigator. In the workbench menu bar, choose 
    <b>Project &gt; Clean...</b> Select <b>Clean selected projects</b> and click <b>Ok</b></li>
  <li>The project is rebuilt and the projectBuilder.xml buildfile is run. Notice 
    the output from this buildfile in the Console view. </li>
  <li>Make sure the Autobuild preference is turned on, then make some trivial 
    change to HelloWorld.java and save the change. The save triggers an auto build, 
    but the auto build does not trigger the project builder. </li>
  <li>Suppose we don't want to see the buildfile output every time it runs. Go back 
    to the External Tools Builders page of the project properties dialog on HW. 
    Select the Makejar entry and click <b>Edit...</b>. On the <b>Main</b> tab, uncheck the 
    <b>Capture Output</b> option, apply the change and exit back to the workbench. 
  </li>
</ol>
<P CLASS="Para">This concludes our look at Ant buildfiles as project builders 
  in Eclipse. It's worth repeating that though this example used a Java project, 
  project builders are not tied to Java, and may be used for any type of project.
