<h3>Saving
perspectives</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">This tutorial has demonstrated how to add new views to the perspective, 
  rearrange the views and convert views into fast views. The Workbench also allows 
  this layout to be saved for future use.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">In the shortcut bar click on the Resource perspective.&nbsp;The 
      Resource perspective is now active.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Drag the Outline view and stack it with one of the navigation 
      views.</p></li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; Save Perspective As...</b></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">The Save Perspective As dialog allows for an existing perspective 
      to be redefined or for a new perspective to be created.</p> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Click <b>OK</b> to update the Resource perspective and <b>Yes</b> 
      to the subsequent confirmation dialog. The new perspective layout will be 
      used if the perspective is reset or if a new one is opened.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/Image71_pers_save.png" alt="Saving Perspective" border="0" ></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">In the Resource perspective move the Outline view so that 
      it is now stacked with the Tasks view.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; Reset Perspective</b>. Notice the Outline 
      view is stacked with the navigation view. Originally when the Workbench 
      was first started it was below the navigation view, but because the perspective 
      was saved with the navigation view and Outline stacked, it now considers 
      this its initial layout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; New Window</b> to open a second window 
      showing the resource perspective. Observe that it uses the newly saved layout.&nbsp;</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">Close the second window.</P>
  </li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Para">While the Resource perspective has been changed, there is a way 
  to get back the original layout. To revert the Resource perspective to its original 
  layout:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Choose <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Expand <b>General</b> and select <b>Perspectives</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Select the <b>Resource</b> perspective and then click <b>Revert</b> on the right side.</p> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/Image71_pers_reset.png" alt="Reset Perspective" border="0"></p></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Any changes to the saved state of the perspective has now 
      been undone. To update the current copy of the Resource perspective that 
      is being worked with, also choose <b>Window &gt; Reset Perspective...</b> from 
      the Workbench's menu bar.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>
