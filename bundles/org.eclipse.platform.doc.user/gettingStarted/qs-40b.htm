Working with fast views</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">The Project Explorer has now been converted into a fast view. This section 
  will demonstrate what can now be done with it.</p>
<p CLASS="Head">Confirm that the shortcut bar at the bottom left of the window 
  still has the Project Explorer view and looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p CLASS="Head"><img src="../images/Image60_fast_view1.png" alt="Fast view on shortcut bar" border="0" ></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">In the shortcut bar click on the Project Explorer fast view button.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Observe the Project Explorer view slides out from the left side of the window.&nbsp; 
    </P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image61_nav_fast.png" alt="Project Explorer view" border="0" ></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head">The Project Explorer fast view can be used as it would be normally.&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
      resize a fast view, move the mouse to the right edge of the fast view where 
      the cursor will change to a double-headed arrow. Then hold the left mouse 
      button down as the mouse is moved. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> To hide the fast view simply click on another view or editor 
      or click on the <b>Minimize</b> button on the fast view's toolbar </P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image61_fast_minimize.png" alt="Minimize fast icon" border="0" > 
    </P>
    <P CLASS="Para">&nbsp; </P>
    <P CLASS="Para"><b>Note:</b> If a file is opened from the a navigation view 
      fast view, the fast view will automatically hide itself to allow the file 
      to be worked with.</P>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>To convert a fast view back to a regular view either: </P>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <b>Fast View</b> from the context menu of the icon in the top left 
    corner of the view. </li>
  <li>Drag the fast view icon from the tool bar, and drop it somewhere in the 
    Workbench window. </li>
</ul>
