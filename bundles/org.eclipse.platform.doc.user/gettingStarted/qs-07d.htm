Using the New button</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">We have seen how to create resources using <b>File &gt; New</b> 
  and <b>New</b> from the context menu of one of the navigation views. We will 
  now create a file for our project using the third alternative, the toolbar <b>New</b> 
  button.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">Select the folder JanesFolder in one of the navigation views.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">In the Workbench window's toolbar, activate the drop-down 
      menu on the New Wizard button <img src="../images/Image15_new_button.png" alt="New Wizard Button" border="0"> 
      and select <b>File</b>. To activate the drop-down menu simply click on the 
      down arrow.</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image16_new_pulldown.png" alt="New Wizard Pulldown" border="0"></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the New File wizard, your folder's name and path already 
      appear by default in the <b> Enter or select the parent folder </b> field. 
      This is because you chose to create the new file while this folder was selected 
      in one of the navigation views and the view was active.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the <b> File name</b> field, type a unique name for a 
      new text file, including the .txt file extension, for example &quot;JanesFile.txt&quot;.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click <b>Finish</b> when you are done.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> The Workbench has an editor capable of editing text files. 
      A text editor is automatically opened on the newly created file.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the text editor, type in the following five lines:</P>
    <blockquote> 
      <P CLASS="Para"><i>This is a sample text file.<br>
        There is not much else<br>
        we can really say about it other<br>
        than it has five lines of<br>
        text that are rather dull.</i></P>
    </blockquote>
    <P CLASS="Para">Notice that the editor tab has an asterisk (*) at the left 
      of the filename. The asterisk indicates that the editor has unsaved changes.</P>
    <blockquote> 
      <P CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/Image17b_unsaved_changes.png" alt="Editor Unsaved Changes" border="0"></P>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the Workbench window's toolbar, click the Save button 
      <img src="../images/Image17_save_button.png"  alt="Save Button" border="0"> 
      to save your work.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In one of the navigation views ensure your folder is still 
      selected and the navigation view is active.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click <strong>New Wizard </strong>in the Workbench toolbar. 
      Previously we clicked on the drop-down arrow of the New button. Here we 
      clicked on the button itself which has the same effect as choosing <b>File 
      &gt; New &gt; Other...</b></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the New wizard, select <b>General &gt; File</b>. 
    Then click <b>Next</b>.</P>
  </li>
  <li> <P CLASS="Para"> Once again, your folder's name and path appears by default in the <b> Enter 
    or select the parent folder </b> field.&nbsp;</P></li>
  <li>
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the <b>File name</b> field, type a unique name for an 
      .ini file, for example &quot;JanesINIFile.ini&quot;. Click Finish when you are done.&nbsp;</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Since the Workbench does not have any editors registered 
      for .ini files, it may launch an external editor on the file if one is registered 
      with the operating system. For the moment, close the editor. </P>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>Now that we have created our resources, one of the navigation views shows our two projects, 
  the folder and its two files. To the right of one of the navigation views is the text 
  editor open on the first file we created (JanesFile.txt). To proceed with the 
  following example create a second file (JanesFile2.txt). </P>


<P><img src="../images/Image18_created_resources.png" alt="Eclipse Workbench" border="0">
</P>


<P>Click the new JanesFile2.txt editor tab. Now select the file JanesINIFile.ini 
  in one of the navigation views. Then select the <b>Link with Editor</b> <img src="../images/synced.png" alt="Link with Editor" border="0">
  button in the local toolbar or view menu <img src="../images/view_menu.png" alt="Link with Editor" border="0">
  of one of the navigation views. Lastly, click on the editor tab for JanesFile.txt.
  Notice how the navigation view updated itself to select the file you are currently 
  editing (JanesFile.txt). If you don't like this automatic update you can easily 
  turn it off by deselecting <b>Link with Editor</b>.</P>
