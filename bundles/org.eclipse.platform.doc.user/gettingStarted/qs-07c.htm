<h3>Using the popup</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
Now that we have our project we will create a folder. We will create
our folder using the Project Explorer view's popup menu.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Activate the Project Explorer view and select the project JaneQuser 
      (the first project we created in the Project Explorer view). From the view's popup 
      menu choose <b>New &gt; Folder</b>.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the New Folder wizard, your project name appears by default 
      in the <b>Enter or select the parent folder </b> field. This is because 
      we chose to create the new folder from your project's context menu.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the <b> Folder name</b> field, type a unique name for 
      your new folder. 
      Depending on the platform you are running on, some characters will not be allowed
      (for example, &quot;Jane's Folder?&quot;).</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image14_new_folder_wizard.png"  alt="New Folder Wizard" border="0"></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click <b>Finish</b> when you are done. The Project Explorer view 
      will update to show your newly created folder.</P>
  </li>
</ol>
<P><strong>Note:</strong> There is now also an <b>Advanced</b> button. This button 
  when selected allows you to enter a location outside of a project's hierarchy 
  as the location for one of its folders. This is called a linked folder.</P>
