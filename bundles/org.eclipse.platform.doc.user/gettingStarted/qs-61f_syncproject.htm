    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The next page will allow you to see the files that are going to
be shared with your team. The arrows with the plus sign show that the
files are new outgoing additions. They have never existed on the server
yet. <br>

  </li>

    to commit the files. Enter a commit comment to describe the commit you are 
    making. You can enter anything you like. Press <strong>Finish</strong> when 
    you are done and the files will be committed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Now you have shared the project and all the files have been
committed to the CVS repository. Others can now see your files!<br>
