Editors</h3>
<p class="Para"> Depending on the type of file that is being edited, the appropriate 
  editor is displayed in the editor area. For example, if a .TXT file is being 
  edited, a text editor is displayed in the editor area. The figure below shows 
  an editor open on the file file1.txt. The name of the file appears in the tab 
  of the editor. An asterisk (*) appearing at the left side of the tab indicates 
  that the editor has unsaved changes. If an attempt is made to close the editor 
  or exit the Workbench with unsaved changes, a prompt to save the editor's changes 
  will appear.</p>

</p>


<p class="Para">When an editor is active, the Workbench menu bar and toolbar contain 
  operations applicable to the editor. When a view becomes active, the editor 
  operations are disabled. However, certain operations may be appropriate 
  in the context of a view and will remain enabled.</p>


<p class="Para"> The editors can be stacked in the editor area and individual 
  editors can be activated by clicking the tab for the editor. Editors can also 
  be tiled side-by-side in the editor area so their content can be viewed simultaneously. 
  In the figure below, editors for JanesFile.txt and JanesFile2.txt have been placed 
  above the editor for JanesText.txt. Instructions will be given later in this tutorial explaining 
  how to rearrange views and editors.</p>

</p>


<p>If a resource does not have an associated editor, the Workbench 
  will attempt to launch an external editor registered with the platform. These 
  external editors are not tightly integrated with the Workbench and are not embedded 
  in the Workbench's editor area. </p>
<p>Editors can be cycled through using the back and forward arrow buttons 
  in the toolbar. These move through the last mouse selection points and permit moving through several points 
  in a file before moving to another one. Additionally, editors can be cycled by using 
  the Ctrl+F6 accelerator (Command+F6 on the Macintosh).  Ctrl+F6 pops up a list of currently 
  open editors. By default, the list will have selected the editor used before the current one, allowing
  you to easely go back to the previous editor.

  On Windows, if the associated editor is an external editor, the Workbench may attempt
  to launch the editor in-place as an 
  OLE document editor. For example, editing a DOC file will cause Microsoft Word 
  to be opened in-place within the Workbench if Microsoft Word is installed on 
  the machine. If Microsoft Word has not been installed, Word Pad will open instead.</p>
