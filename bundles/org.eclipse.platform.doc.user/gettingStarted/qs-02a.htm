<h2>
The Workbench</h2>
<P CLASS="Para"> When the Workbench is launched, the first thing you see is a 
  dialog that allows you to select where the workspace should be located. The
  workspace is the directory where your work will be stored. For now, just
  click OK to pick the default location.</p>
<p>After the workspace location is chosen, a single Workbench window is displayed. 
  A Workbench window offers one or more perspectives. A perspective contains 
  editors and views, such as the Project Explorer. Multiple Workbench windows can be 
  opened simultaneously. Initially, in the first Workbench window that is opened,
  the Java perspective is displayed, with only the Welcome view visible. 
  Click the arrow labeled <b>Workbench</b> in the Welcome view to cause the other
  views in the perspective to become visible. Note you can get the Welcome view back at any time by selecting
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.help.quickStartAction")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
  <b>Help &gt; Welcome</b></a>.</p>
<p>A shortcut bar appears in the top right corner of the window. This allows you
  to open new perspectives and switch between ones already open. The name of the 
  active perspective is shown in the title of the window and its item in the shortcut 
  bar is highlighted.</p>
<p>You should be seeing the Java perspective. We will switch to the simpler Resource perspective
  to simplify this tutorial. Select 
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective(org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective.perspectiveId=org.eclipse.ui.resourcePerspective)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
  <b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other... &gt; Resource</b></a>.
  The Project Explorer, Outline, and Tasks views should now be visible. <br>
