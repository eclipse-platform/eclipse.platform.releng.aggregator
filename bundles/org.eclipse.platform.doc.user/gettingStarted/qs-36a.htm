  <li> The <b>Case sensitive</b> check box can be selected or deselected depending 
    on whether or not a case sensitive or insensitive search is to be performed.
    You can also select the <b>Regular expression</b> check box to enable more powerful searching
    capabilities. To see what is available in regular expression mode, you can hit
    Ctrl-Space over the text field to get content assistance that lists the possibilites.
    For this example, just check the <b>Case sensitive</b> box to search for lowercase 
    &quot;<i>it</i>&quot;.</li>
  <li> The kinds of files to include in the search can be specified in the <b>File 
    name patterns</b> field. Click <b>Choose...</b> to open the Select Types dialog. 
    This dialog provides a quick way to select from a list of registered extensions. 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_choose_ext.gif"  alt="Type Selection Dialog" border="0"></blockquote>

    checked and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Scope</b> field, specify the files and folders to include in the 
    search. The choices are: the entire workspace, the currently selected resources 
    in the Workbench, or a working set which is a named, customized group of files 
    and folders. Leave the scope as workspace.</li>

    in the dialog. This setting may be left unchanged.</li>
