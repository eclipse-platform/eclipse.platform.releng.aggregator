<h3>Starting a search</h3>

<p>Text strings can be searched for in the Workbench as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Workbench toolbar, click the search button <img src="../images/Image50_search.png"  alt="Search button" border="0">.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Containing text</b> field, type in: <i>it</i> <br>
    The combo box for the <b>Containing text</b> field also displays a list of 
    recently performed searches to select from.<br>
    <img src="../images/Image51_search_it.png"  alt="Search dialog" border="0"></li>
  <li> The <b>Case sensitive</b> checkbox can be selected or deselected depending 
    on whether or not a case sensitive or insensitive search is to be performed.
    You can also select the <b>Regular expression</b> checkbox to enable more powerful searching
    capabilities. To see what is available in regular expression mode, you can hit
    Ctrl-Space over the text field to get content assistance that lists the possibilities.
    For this example, just check the <b>Case sensitive</b> box to search for lowercase 
    &quot;<i>it</i>&quot;.</li>
  <li> The kinds of files to include in the search can be specified in the <b>File 
    name patterns</b> field. Click <b>Choose...</b> to open the Select Types dialog. 
    This dialog provides a quick way to select from a list of registered extensions.

    For the moment, the search will be confined to .txt files. Ensure *.txt is 
    checked and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Scope</b> field, specify the files and folders to include in the 
    search. The choices are: the entire workspace, the currently selected resources 
    in the Workbench, or a working set which is a named, customized group of files 
    and folders. Leave the scope as workspace.</li>
  <li> Use the <b>Customize</b> button to choose what kinds of searches are available 
    in the dialog. This setting may be left unchanged.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Search</b>. At this point, the Search view will be made visible, 
    and it will begin to fill in with the results of the search. The stop button 
    in the Search view can be clicked to cancel the search while it is in progress. 
  </li>
  <li>Observe that the Search view displays:

  </li>
</ol>

<p> The next section will describe how to work with the Search view.</p>
