<h3>
External editors</h3>
<p class="Para">When opening a resource the Workbench first consults its list 
  of registered editors. If no registered editors are found for the resource the 
  Workbench checks with the underlying operating system to determine if it has 
  any editors registered for the particular file type. If an editor is located, 
  the Workbench will automatically launch that editor. This type of editor is 
  referred to as an external editor because it does not show up as an editor tab 
  in the Workbench.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p class="Para">Select the file JanesINIFile.ini.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="Para">
Double-click the file in one of the navigation views to launch the external editor.</p>
    <p class="Para"> If an editor for INI files is not registered with the underlying 
      operating system the Workbench will attempt to use its own default text 
      editor. If this happens, to see an external editor, import another file 
      (see previous sections) that is associated with a third party editor. Double 
      click again on this new file and the selected editor will open in its own 
      window.</p>
<p class="Para" filter="ws=win32"><img src="../images/win_only.png" alt="Windows only" border="0" /><br />
      The Workbench supports OLE document editors, and some editors provide OLE 
      document support allowing it to be opened in its own window, or embedded 
      inside another window like the Workbench. This will be discussed in more 
      detail in the next section.</p>
