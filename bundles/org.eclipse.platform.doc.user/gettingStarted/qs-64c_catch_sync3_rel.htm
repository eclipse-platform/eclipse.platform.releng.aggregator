<h3> Committing</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> The Outgoing Mode of the Synchronize view will now be used to 
  commit the one remaining outgoing change.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Place the Synchronize view into outgoing mode by clicking on the Outgoing 
    Mode button (#1) and confirming that the title of the view now indicates Outgoing 
    Mode (#2). 
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_relmode.png" alt="Outgoing mode" border="0" ></p>
      </li>
  <li>Open file3.txt (the outgoing change) by double-clicking.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The comparison viewer shows that&nbsp;the local copy of file3.txt has a 
    change to the second line.&nbsp; The repository copy is shown in the right 
    pane. 
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_jane.png" alt="Text compare" border="0" ></li>
  <li>From the context menu of file3.txt choose <b>Commit</b>. 
      Be sure to enter a meaningful description when prompted for one.&nbsp; 
    <p>The Workbench copy is now committed into the repository.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para"> At this point Fred may want to synchronize with the repository 
      to update his workspace with the changes just committed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>By making simultaneous changes to the same project you have successfully collaborated 
  with Fred. The Synchronize view and CVS Resource History view allowed you to 
  determine the specific changes each user was making and to quickly stay on top 
  of the ongoing changes being committed into the repository. </P>
