Perspectives</h2>
<p>A perspective defines the initial set and layout of
views in the Workbench window. One or more perspectives can exist in a single
Workbench window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perspectives can be opened in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>In the same (existing) Workbench window.</p> </li>
  <li><p>In a new Workbench window.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>Perspectives define visible action sets, which can 
  be changed to customize a perspective. A perspective that is built in this manner 
  can be saved, creating a custom perspective that can be opened again later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Workbench window displays one or more perspectives. Each 
  product determines initially what default perspective is displayed, in this 
  example it is the Resource perspective. A perspective consists of views such 
  as the Project Explorer as well as editors for working with resources. More than one 
  Workbench window can be open at any given time.&nbsp; </P>
<P> So far, only the Resource perspective (shown below) has been 
  used in this tutorial. This section will explore how to open and work with other 
  perspectives. </P>
<P> A perspective provides a set of functionality aimed at accomplishing 
  a specific type of task, or working with a specific type of resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;
