Moving</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">Having copied and renamed several of the resources, now it's time 
  to move some resources around. JanesOtherFolder and its file will be moved to 
  be a sub-folder of the original folder JanesFolder.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Project Explorer view, select JanesOtherFolder. </li>
  <li>From the file's context menu, select <b>Move</b>.</li>
  <li><p>In the Folder Selection dialog choose JanesFolder and click <b>OK</b>.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/Image48_move.png"  alt="Folder dialog" border="0"></p>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>In the Project Explorer JanesFolder now contains JanesOtherFolder. Expand
JanesOtherFolder and confirm that it contains JanesText.txt.

</blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>


<P>As an alternative to moving files using the move operation, it is also possible 
  to move files by dragging a file from one folder to another folder. Remember 
  that to copy files from one folder to the other, Ctrl needs to be held down 
  while performing the drag and drop operation. (On the Macintosh, the Option 
  key is used for this.) </P>
