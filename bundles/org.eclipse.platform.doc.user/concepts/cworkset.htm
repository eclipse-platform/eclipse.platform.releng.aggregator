Working sets</H1>
<P>
Working sets group elements for display in views or for operations on a set 
of elements. </P>

<P> The navigation views use working sets to restrict 
  the set of resources that are displayed. If a working set is selected in the 
  navigator, only resources, children of resources, and parents of resources contained 
  in the working set are shown. The problems view, tasks view and bookmarks view 
  can all be filtered based on a working set via the <b>Configure Contents</b> view menu item. 
  When using the search facility, 
  you can also use working sets to restrict the set of elements that are searched. 
</P>

<P> Different views provide different ways to specify 
  a working set.  The views in the Eclipse SDK use the <b>Window Working Set</b> by 
  default. The Window Working Set is initially empty. In order to modify the window working set
  you need to enable the <b>Window Working Set</b> command group via <b>Window &gt; Customize Perspective...</b>. You can then
  modify the window working set via <b>Window &gt; Working Sets</b> menu or via corresponding toolbar button. Views that support working sets typically use the following 
  working set selection dialog to manage existing working sets and to create new working sets:</P>

</P>

<P>
When you create a new working set you can choose from different types
of working sets. In the example below you can create a resource working set, a
Java working set or a help working set.

<P>
If you create a new resource working set you will be able to select the working 
set resources as shown below. The same wizard is used to edit an existing working
set. Different types of working sets provide different kinds of working set 
editing wizards.

<p>
Working sets may also be a part of a manual build workflow.  With autobuild disabled the 
<b>Project &gt; Build Working Set</b> menu becomes enabled.  From here you are able to selectively build working sets of your choosing.
</p>

<DIV CLASS="Note">
  <P> <strong>Note:</strong> Newly created resources are 
    not automatically included in the active working set. They are implicitly 
    included in a working set if they are children of an existing working set 
    element. If you want to include other resources after you have created them 
    you have to explicitly add them to the working set. </P>
