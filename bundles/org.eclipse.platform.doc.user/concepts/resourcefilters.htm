<p>
Resource filters allow you to configure which files and folders are included automatically
in a project resource hierarchy when refresh is performed.
</p>
<p>
By adding resource filters to a project or folder, you can systematically prevent some file 
system entries to be displayed in the resource tree. 
</p>
<p>
A resource filter is either of <b>Include Only</b> or <b>Exclude All</b> type, and can apply to either files,
folders, or both.
</p>
<p>
Resource filters only apply to files and/or folders that are implicitly included in the workspace
by the refresh operation.  Link files and folders are not affected by resource filters, since they 
need to be created explicitly by the user.
</p>
<p>
An "Include" resource filter allows only files and/or folders that match the filter condition
to be included in the workspace during the refresh operation. If multiple "Include" filters exist, 
the elements included will be those who match any of the existing "Include" filters. 
</p>
<p>
An "Exclude" resource filter prevent all files and/or folders that match the filter condition
to be included in the workspace during the refresh operation. If multiple "Exclude" filters exist, 
the elements excluded will be those who match any of the existing "Exclude" filters. 
</p>
<p>
If both "Exclude" and "Include" resource filters exist in a given folder or project, only files 
and/or folders that match any of the "Include" filters <b>and </b> do not match any of the "Exclude"
filters will be included in the workspace. 
</p>
<p>
A resource filter can apply recursively to all children of the project or folder it is created on.  In 
such case, the resource filter will apply to a sub-folder as if it was created in that sub-folder 
itself, following the rules mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
Resource filters can be created, edited and removed in 
the <b>File &gt; Properties &gt; Resource &gt; Resources Filters</b> property page for a project or
folder resource.
</p>
<p>
Resource filters can also be created on a folder before that folder is created in the workspace by 
selecting the "Resource Filters..." button in the "Advanced" section of the <b>New Folder wizard</b>.
