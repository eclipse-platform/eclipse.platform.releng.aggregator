  <h1 class="Head">Detached views</h1>
  <p>Detached views and editors are shown in a separate window with a smaller trim. They work like other views and
  editors except they are always shown in front of the Workbench window.</p>
  <p>You can create a new detached view or editor by dragging any open part outside of the Workbench window or by
  selecting <b>Detached</b> from the menu that opens when you right-click the part's tab.</p>
