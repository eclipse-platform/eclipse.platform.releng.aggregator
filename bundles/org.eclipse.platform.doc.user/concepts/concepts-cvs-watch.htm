<h1 class="Head"> Watch/Edit</h1>
   
<p class="Para"> CVS provides a notification scheme which allows a group of developers 
  to know if somebody is working on a given file. This facility is known as <em>watches</em>. 
  By setting a <em>watch</em> on a file, you can have CVS notify you via email 
  if someone else starts to <em>edit</em> this file. This mechanism is notification 
  based only; the file is not locked in any way on the server, and several people 
  are allowed to edit the same file at the same time.</p>
<p class="Para">In addition to watch list notification, <em>edit</em> on its own 
  is useful for discovering if others are also editing that file. This is because 
  when you edit a file, you will be informed if someone else is already editing 
  it. </p>
<p class="Para">Normally with CVS clients, you would need to issue an explicit <em>edit</em>.
  With Team CVS support however, an <em>edit</em> is 
  automatically issued by the client when you start to modify a file. In addition, 
  when <em>editing</em> a file, Team CVS provides you with the list of people 
  already editing a file. This allows you to find out who is working on a file 
  before you start to edit it.</p>
