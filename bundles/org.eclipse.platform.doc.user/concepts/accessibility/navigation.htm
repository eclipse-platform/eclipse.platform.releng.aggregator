 <title>Navigating the user interface using the keyboard</title>
</head>

 <h1>Navigating the user interface using the keyboard</h1>
 <p>The user interface is navigable using the keyboard. The Tab key is used to
 iterate through the controls in a particular scope (for example, a dialog or a view and
 its related icons). To navigate to the main controls for the Workbench window
 or to tab out of views that use the Tab key (such as editors) use Ctrl+Tab.</p>
 <h2>Menus</h2>
 <p>Most menus are assigned mnemonics for each entry which allow you to
 select them by typing the underlined letter instead of the mouse. You can also
 select an item by moving through the menus and sub-menus with the arrow keys. </p>
 <p>The various menus available can be accessed using the keyboard in the
 following ways: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>F10 accesses the menus on the main menu bar.</li>
  <li>Shift+F10 pops up the context menu for the current view. (Note: this
  shortcut is actually dependent on your window manager, but for most people it
  should be Shift+F10.)</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F10 will open the pull down menu for the current view if there is
    one.  For editors, Ctrl+F10 will open the menu for the marker bar on the left of the
    editor area.</li>
  <li>Alt+mnemonic will activate the Workbench menu for a particular entry
    (e.g., Alt+W will bring down the Window menu).</li>
  <li>Microsoft Windows only: Pressing Alt will give focus to the menu
  bar.</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Controls</h2>
 <p>Mnemonics are assigned to most control labels (e.g., buttons, checkboxes,
 radio buttons, etc.) in dialog boxes, preference pages, and property pages. To
 access the control associated with a label, use the Alt key along with the
 letter that is underlined in the label.</p>
 <h2>Navigation Context</h2>
 <p>Navigation context is saved for the packages, navigator views, Workbench preferences and properties dialogs.
 The selected page for the preferences and properties dialog is saved between
 invocations of the dialog but are not saved between workbench invocations. </p>
 <h2>Cycling Editors, Views and Perspectives </h2>
 <p>To switch between editors, views and perspectives, the workbench provides a cycling
 function that is invoked by Ctrl and a function key. All of these cycling
 functions recall the last thing selected to allow for rapid cycling back and
 forth between two items. The cycling functions are </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ctrl+F6 - Cycle to Editor</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F7 - Cycle to View</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F8 - Cycle to Perspective</li>
 </ul>
  <p>If you use the &quot;StickyKeys&quot; input, you might need to enable the &quot;Keep next/previous editor, 
 view and perspectives dialog open&quot; option on the

<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Workbench)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
<strong>General</strong></a>
 
 preference page.</p>
 <p>Also, Ctrl+E can be used to activate the editor drop-down, and Ctrl+PageUp
 and Ctrl+PageDown can be used for switching between the open editors.</p>
 <h2>Accelerators </h2>
 
<p>Many of the actions in Eclipse have an accelerator assigned to them. For additional 
  information on accelerators, see <a href="keyboardshortcuts.htm">Keys</a>. </p>
 <h2>Quick Access </h2>
 
<p>To quickly access UI elements such as views,
commands, preference pages, and others, you can use the Quick Access dialog,
available under <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.quickAccess")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
<b>Window &gt; Navigation &gt; Quick Access</b></a> and bound to <b>Ctrl+3</b> by
default. Start typing in the filter field to see matches. For example,
to open the help view, type Ctrl+3 followed by &quot;help&quot;. One
of the first matches will be to open the help view; other matches show
commands and preference pages related to help. You can use the
arrow keys to select a different match for a given filter string. Press
Enter to select the highlighted entry. This will execute the command, or
open the view, perspective, or wizard etc.</p>
<h2>Following Embedded Links</h2>
<p>For links embedded in dialogs, such as the links between preference pages, 
or hyper-links in the About dialog, press &quot;Space&quot; key to activate the currently 
selected link.
</p>
<h2>Changing Size of Views and Editors</h2>
<p>You can adjust size of most views and editors using commands in the &quot;Size&quot;
 system menu. By default the system menu for the active part is bound to <b>Alt+&quot;-&quot;</b>. 
 After a &quot;Size&quot; submenu (Left, Right, Top, or Bottom) is selected, the selected 
 part's side will be highlighted and can be moved using the arrow keys.
</p>

 <h2>Help system</h2>
 <p>You can navigate the help system by keyboard using the following key 
 combinations:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Pressing Tab inside a frame (page) takes you to the next link, button or 
   topic node. </li>
   <li>To expand/collapse a tree node, press Right/Left arrows. </li>
   <li>To move to the next topic node, press Down arrow or Tab </li>
   <li>To move to the previous topic node, press Up arrow or Shift+Tab </li>
   <li>To display selected topic, press Enter. </li>
   <li>To scroll all the way up or down press Home or End. </li>
   <li>To go back press Alt+Left arrow; to go forward press Alt+Right arrow.
   </li>
   <li>To go to the next frame, or toolbar press Ctrl+Tab
     (Ctrl+F6, if using Mozilla, or Mozilla based browser).</li>
   <li>To move to previous frame, press Shift+Ctrl+Tab.
     (Shift-Ctrl+F6, if using Mozilla, or Mozilla based browser).</li>

   <li>To move to the frame displaying topic content press Alt+K (when using
     embedded help browser on Windows, or Internet Explorer).</li>
   <li>To move to Contents tab, press Alt+C</li>
   <li>To move to Search Results tab, press Alt+R</li>
   <li>To move between tabs, press Right/Left arrows.</li>
   <li>To switch view, select a tab and press Enter.</li>
   <li>To switch and move to a view, select a tab and press Up arrow.</li>
   <li>To move to the search entry field, press Alt+S</li>
   <li>To print the current page or active frame, press Ctrl+P. </li>
   <li>To find a string in the current page or active frame, press Ctrl+F
     (when using embedded help browser on Windows, or Internet Explorer). </li>
 </ul>
<p>Most labels of controls
on help system pop-up dialogs have mnemonics are assigned to them. To access
  the control associated with a label, use the Alt key along with the letter
  that
 is underlined.</p>
