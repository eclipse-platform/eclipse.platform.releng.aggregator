 <h1>Navigating the user interface using the keyboard</h1>
 <p>The user interface is navigable using the keyboard. The Tab key is used to
 iterate through the controls in a particular scope (for example, a dialog or a view and
 its related icons). To navigate to the main controls for the Workbench window
 or to tab out of views that use the Tab key (such as editors) use Ctrl+Tab. </p>
 <h2>Menus</h2>
 <p>Most menus are assigned mnemonics for each entry which allow you to
 select them by typing the underlined letter instead of the mouse. You can also
 select an item by moving through the menus and sub-menus with the arrow keys. </p>
 <p>The various menus available can be accessed using the keyboard in the
 following ways: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>F10 accesses the menus on the main menu bar.</li>
  <li>Shift + F10 pops up the context menu for the current view.</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F10 will pull down the pull down menu for the current view if there is
    one.</li>
  <li>Alt - pops up the main view menu.</li>
  <li>Alt + mnemonic will activate the Workbench menu for a particular entry
    (i.e. Alt + W will bring down the <u>W</u>indow menu).</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Controls</h2>
 <p>Mnemonics are assigned to most labels of controls (for 
 example, buttons, check boxes, radio buttons) in dialog boxes, 
 preference pages, and property pages. To access the control associated
 with a label, use the Alt key along with the letter that is underlined 
 in the label. </p>
 <h2>Navigation Context</h2>
 <p>Navigation context is saved for the packages, navigator views, Workbench preferences and properties dialogs. The expanded state of the tree in
 the packages and resource views are saved between Workbench sessions. The
 selected page for the preferences and properties dialog is saved between
 invocations of the dialog but are not saved between workbench invocations. </p>
 <h2>Cycling Editors, Views and Perspectives </h2>
 <p>To switch between editors, views and perspectives, the workbench provides a cycling
 function that is invoked by Ctrl and a function key. All of these cycling
 functions recall the last thing selected to allow for rapid cycling back and
 forth between two items. The cycling functions are </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ctrl+F6 - Cycle to Editor</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F7 - Cycle to View</li>
  <li>Ctrl+F8 - Cycle to Perspective</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Accelerators </h2>
 
<p>Many of the actions in Eclipse have an accelerator assigned to them. For the 
  full list of these accelerators see <a href="keyboardshortcuts.htm">Keys</a>. 
</p>
 <h2>Help system</h2>
 <p>You can navigate the help system by keyboard using the following key 
 combinations:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Pressing Tab inside a frame (page) takes you to the next link, button or 
   topic node. </li>
   <li>To expand/collapse a tree node, press Right/Left arrows. </li>
   <li>To move to the next topic node, press Down arrow or Tab </li>
   <li>To move to the previous topic node, press Up arrow or Shift+Tab </li>
   <li>To display selected topic, press Enter. </li>
   <li>To scroll all the way up or down press Home or End. </li>
   <li>To go back press Alt+Left arrow; to go forward press Alt+Right arrow.
   </li>
   <li>To go to the next frame, or toolbar press Ctrl+Tab
     (Ctrl+F6, if using browser based on Mozilla 1.2 or newer).</li>
   <li>To move to previous frame, press Shift+Ctrl+Tab.
     (Shift-Ctrl+F6, if using browser based on Mozilla 1.2 or newer).</li>

   <li>To move between tabs, press Right/Left arrows.</li>
   <li>To switch view, select a tab and press Enter.</li>
   <li>To switch and move to a view, select a tab and press Up arrow.</li>
   <li>To print the current page or active frame, press Ctrl+P. </li>
 </ul>
