<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
The welcome page is the first page you see when you first launch eclipse. Its purpose
is to introduce you to the product. Welcome content will vary from one Eclipse based product to 
another, it typically includes an overview of
the product and its features, tutorials to guide you through some basic tasks,
samples to get you started, etc.

<p>
There are many possible forms of welcome, ranging from simple static text to
elaborate extendable multi-page presentations. The Eclipse platform and platform 
SDK uses a form known as&nbsp; <strong>Universal Welcome</strong>, which
defines a common page structure, allowing several products to share the welcome
space. If your product is using the Universal Welcome, you can
<a href="../tasks/welcome.htm">customize</a> its appearance using the "customize page" button. 
Products which use universal welcome will display a welcome page the first time 
they are restarted after new features with welcome content are installed and 
highlight the new welcome content.</p>
