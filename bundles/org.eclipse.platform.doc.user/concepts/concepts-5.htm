<P> Views support editors and provide alternative presentations 
  as well as ways to navigate the information in your Workbench.&nbsp; For example, 
  the Project Explorer and other navigation views display projects and other resources that you are working 
  with.</P>
<P>
 Views also have their own menus. To open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left
end of the view's title bar. Some views also have their own toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view
toolbars only affect the items within that view.&nbsp;</P>
<P>
A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other
views in a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;You can change the layout of a perspective by
opening and closing views and by docking them in different
positions in the Workbench window.&nbsp; </P>
