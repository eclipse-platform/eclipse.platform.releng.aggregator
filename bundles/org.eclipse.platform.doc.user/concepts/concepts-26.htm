<h1 class="Head">Team programming with CVS</h1>
       
<p class="Para">In the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) team programming environment,
   team members do all of their work in their own Workbenches, isolated from
others.    Eventually they will want to share their work. They do this via
a CVS Repository.</p>
       
<h2 class="Para">Branches</h2>
       
<p class="Para">CVS uses a branch model to support multiple courses of work 
 that    are somewhat isolated from each other but still highly interdependent. 
 Branches    are where a development team shares and integrates ongoing work. 
 A branch can    be thought of as a shared workspace that is updated by team 
 members as they    make changes to the project. This model allows individuals 
 to work on a CVS    team project, share their work with others as changes 
 are made, and access the    work of others as the project evolves. A special 
 branch, referred to as HEAD,    represents the main course of work in the 
repository (HEAD is often referred    to as the trunk).</p>
       
<h2 class="Para">Sharing work</h2>
       
<div class="Topic">      
<p class="Para">As team members produce new work, they share this work by 
 <i>committing</i>      those changes to the branch. Similarly, when they 
wish to get the latest available      work, they <i>update</i> their local 
workspaces to the changes on the branch.&nbsp;      Thus the branch is constantly 
changing, moving forward as team members submit      new work.</p>
         
<p class="Para">The branch effectively represents the current state of the 
 project.      At any point a team member can update their workspaces from the branch and know
 they are up      to date.</p>

<h2>Optimistic team model</h2>
         
<p class="Para">CVS provides two important features required for working in
     a team:</p>
         
<ul>
        <li>                      
    <p class="Para">A history of the work submitted by the team     </p>
     </li>
     <li>                      
    <p class="Para">A way to coordinate and integrate this work   </p>
     </li>
     
</ul>
         
<p class="Para">Maintaining history is important so that one can compare the
     current work against previous drafts, revert to older work that is better, and
so on.      Coordinating the work is critical so that there exists one definition
of the      current project state, containing the integrated work of the
team. This coordination      is provided via the branch model.</p>
         
<p class="Para">An optimistic model is one where any member of the team can 
      make changes to any resource he or she has access to.&nbsp; Because 
two team      members can commit to the branch changes to the same resource, 
 conflicts      can occur and must be dealt with. This model is termed <i>
   optimistic</i> because      it is assumed that conflicts are rare.</p>
         
<h2>Recommended work flow</h2>
         
<p class="Para">Usually resources do not exist in isolation, they typically
    contain implicit or explicit dependencies on other resources.&nbsp; For
    example, Web pages have links to other Web pages, and source code has
  references to artifacts described in other source code resources.&nbsp; 
 No resource is an island.</p>
         
<p class="Para">As resources are committed to the branch, these dependencies 
      can be affected. Ensuring the integrity of the dependencies is important 
 because      the branch represents the current project state: at any point 
 a team member      could take the branch contents as a basis for new work.</p>
         
<p class="Para">The ideal work flow therefore is one in which the branch integrity
     is preserved. </p>

<h3 class="Para"><a name="IdealWorkFlow">Ideal flow enumerated</a></h3>

<p class="Para">The ideal work flow proceeds as follows:</p>
         
<ol>
        <li>                      
    <p class="Para">Start fresh. Before starting work, update the resources
    in the workspace with 
 the          current branch state. If you are sure that you have no local 
 work that          you care about, the fastest way to get caught up is to 
 select the projects          you are interested in from the branch (or HEAD) 
 and select <b>Checkout</b> (or <b>Replace with &gt; Latest from Repository</b>
 if the projects already exist locally). This will overwrite your 
local resources with those from          the branch.          </p>
     </li>
     <li>                      
    <p class="Para">Make changes. Work locally in your Workbench, creating 
 new       resources, modifying existing ones, saving locally as you go. 
   </p>
     </li>
     <li>                      
    <p class="Para">Synchronize. When you are ready to commit your work, synchronize
         with the repository.</p>
                 
    <ol type="a">
            <li>                                      
        <p class="Para">Update. Examine incoming changes and add them to your
             local Workbench. This allows you to determine if there are changes
             which might affect the integrity of what you are about to commit.
             Resolve conflicts. Test again, run integrity checkers (for example,
			 check for broken hypertext links, ensure your code compiles,
			 and so on).</p>
         </li>
         <li>                                      
        <p class="Para">Commit. Now that you are confident that your changes 
              are well integrated with the latest branch contents, commit your 
              changes to the branch. To be prudent, you may repeat the previous              
              step if there are new incoming changes.           
    </p>
         </li>
                 
    </ol>
        </li>
         
</ol>
         
<p class="Para">Of course this is an <i>ideal</i> work flow. Under certain 
 conditions      you may be confident that the incoming changes do not affect 
 you and choose      to commit without updating. However, in general team 
members should make an      effort to follow a flow similar to the above in
order to ensure that the branch      integrity is not accidentally compromised.&nbsp;
