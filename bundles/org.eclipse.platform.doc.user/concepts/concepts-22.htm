Builds</H1>
<p CLASS="Head">
A <i>build</i> is a process that derives new resources from existing ones, updates existing resources, or both.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head">
In the Workbench,&nbsp;different <i>builders</i> are invoked for different types
of projects. For example, when a build is triggered for a Java project, a Java
builder converts each Java source file (.java files) into one or more executable class files
(.class files). Builders usually enforce the constraints of some
domain. For example, a Web link builder could update links to files
whose name/location changes.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of builds:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An <i>incremental build</i> leverages a
    previously built state and applies the transforms of the configured builders
    to the resources that have changed since the previous state was computed
    (that is, since the last build).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>A clean build discards any problems and 
    previously built state.  The next build after a clean will transform all resources according to
    the domain rules of the configured builders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Incremental and clean builds can be done over a specific set of projects or
the workspace as a whole.&nbsp;Specific files and folders cannot be built. There are two ways that builds can be performed:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Automatic builds are performed as resources are saved. Automatic builds 
    are always incremental and always operate over the entire workspace. You can 
    configure your preferences
    (<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Workspace)")'>

    <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Workspace</b></a>) to 
    perform builds automatically on resource modification.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
Manual builds are initiated when you explicitly select a menu item or press the
equivalent shortcut key. Manual builds can be either clean or incremental and can operate over collections of projects 
or the entire workspace.</li>
