<H1 CLASS="Head">Problems view</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> As you work with resources in the workbench, various builders 
  may automatically log problems, errors, or warnings in the Problems view. For 
  example, when you save a Java source file that contains syntax errors, those 
  will be logged in the Problems view. When you double-click the icon for a problem, 
  error, or warning, the editor for the associated resource automatically opens 
  to the relevant line of code.&nbsp;</P>
<p><img src="../images/prob.png" alt="Picture of the Problems view with two warnings added to it." border="0" ></p>
<p CLASS="Head">By default the Problems view will group your problems by severity. 
  You can also group them by type or not at all. Certain components will add their 
  own grouping. For instance the Java development tools (JDT) support adds a Java 
  Problem Type group. The grouping can be selected using the <b>Group By</b> menu.</p>
<p CLASS="Head">The first column of the Problems view displays an icon that denotes 
  the type of line item, the category and the description. Left-click the item to 
  open the file in an editor and highlight the line containing the problem. 
</p>
<p CLASS="Head">You can configure the contents of the Problems view to view only warnings 
  and errors associated with a particular resource or group of resources. This is done
  using the <b>Configure Contents</b> dialog available from the drop down menu. You can
  add multiple filters to the Problems view and enable or disable 
  them as required. Filters can either be additive (any problem that satisfies at least 
  one of the enables filters will be shown) or exclusive (only problems that satisfy all
  of the filters will be shown)  The two most popular filters (All Errors and Warnings on
  Selection) are provided by default.</p>
<p><img src="../images/prbfil.png" alt="Picture of the Filters options." border="0" ></p>
<p>Problems can be fixed by selecting <b>Quick Fix</b> from the context menu. The list 
  of possible resolutions will be shown.</p>
