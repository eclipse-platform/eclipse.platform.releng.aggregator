Resources</H1>
<p CLASS="Head"> <i>Resources</i> is a collective term for the projects, folders, 
  and files that exist in the Workbench. The navigation views provide a hierarchical 
  view of resources and allows you to open them for editing. Other tools may display 
  and handle these resources differently.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head">There are three basic types of resources that exist in the
Workbench:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Files</dt>
  <dd>Comparable to files as you see them in the file system.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Folders</dt>
  <dd>Comparable to directories on a file system.&nbsp; In the Workbench,
    folders are contained in projects or other folders. Folders can contain
    files and other folders.</dd>
  <dt>Projects</dt>
  <dd>Contain folders and files. Projects are used for builds, version
    management, sharing, and resource organization. Like folders, projects map
    to directories in the file system. (When you create a project, you specify a
    location for it in the file system.)</dd>

  <dd>A project is either open or closed. When a project is closed, it cannot be
    changed in the Workbench.&nbsp; The resources of a closed project will not
    appear in the Workbench, but the resources still reside on the local file
    system.&nbsp; Closed projects require less memory.&nbsp; Since they are not
    examined during builds, closing a project can improve build time.</dd><dd>When a project is open, the structure of the project can be changed and
    you will see the contents.&nbsp;</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Folders and files can be linked to locations in the file system
outside of the project's location.  These special folders and files are called 
<a href="concepts-13.htm">linked resources</a>.
</p>
<p>Different tools that plug into the Workbench use their own specialized types
of projects, folders, and files.&nbsp;</p>
