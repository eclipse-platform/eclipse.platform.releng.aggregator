<h1 class="Head"> Versions</h1>
   
<p class="Para"> Resources are versioned in order to capture a snapshot 
of the current state of the resources at one specific point in time. Resources
in CVS are versioned by tagging them with a version label. When a resource
is versioned, it means that a non-modifiable copy of it can be retrieved
from the repository. </p>
   
<p class="Intro">Versioning a project saves the line up of all resource versions 
in the project. Resources other than projects (files and folders) 
can be versioned. However, it is more common to version entire projects 
together as the resources contained in a project are often highly interdependent. 
Projects can be versioned from the workspace or from the branch (including HEAD) in the 
CVS Repositories view. The difference between these two approaches is in
deciding which child resource versions should be part of the project version.
 </p>
 
<p class="Para"> When tagging a project as a version from the <i>Workbench</i>,    
the base revisions of the files in the Workbench are tagged as belonging 
to that version.&nbsp; This is the preferred method of versioning a project 
because you know exactly which file revisions will be in the version.&nbsp;This 
operation is allowed if you have outgoing changes or uncommitted changes. 
Uncommitted changes are simply ignored and resources with outgoing changes 
can still have their base revisions be part of the version.&nbsp; Versioning 
a project with uncommitted or outgoing changes is handy if you have to 
split the project at the point where you started making changes to the 
resources and commit the resources to another branch.</p>
   
<p class="Para"> When tagging a project as a version from a <i>branch</i>
in the CVS Repositories view, you are versioning whatever the latest 
resource versions are in the branch at that moment in time. You should
not version your projects from the branch if you do not know what is committed
in the branch. For this reason, versioning from the Workbench is often
preferable.</p>
