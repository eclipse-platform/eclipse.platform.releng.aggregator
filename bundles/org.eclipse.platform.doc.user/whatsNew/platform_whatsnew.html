  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Eclipse on Vista</b></td>
    <td>The win32 version of Eclipse now runs beautifully on Windows Vista. SWT now exploits
    native features of the Vista platform, such as native double-buffering to make
    painting in double-buffered canvases twice as fast.

    <td><p align="right"><b>New Eclipse WPF port</b></td>
    <td><p>Eclipse is now available on Windows Presentation
        Foundation (WPF), a new window system that comes pre-installed on Microsoft Windows Vista.<br>
        <br>
        This port is in early access form for 3.3.  While this port is stable enough for 
        exploration and development, it has not yet matured to the level of stability
        and performance you have come to expect from the Eclipse platform. Stay
        tuned for more improvements on this platform in future releases.

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Quick access</b></td>
    <td>To quickly access UI elements such as views,
      commands, preference pages, and others, use the new Quick Access dialog,
      available under <b>Window &gt; Navigation</b> and bound to <b>Ctrl+3</b> by
      default. Start typing in the filter field to see matches. For example,
      to open the console view, type Ctrl+3 followed by "con". One
      of the first matches will be to open the console view. You can use the
      arrow keys to select a different match for a given filter string. Press
      Enter to select the highlighted entry. This will execute the command, or
      open the view, perspective, or wizard etc.
      <p><img src="images/ctrl-3-1.png" alt="Ctrl+3 shot 1"></p>
      <p>Your previous choices will be remembered and shown the next time the
        dialog opens. If you enter the same filter string again, the entry you
        picked last time will be selected automatically.</p>
      <p><img src="images/ctrl-3-2.png" alt="Ctrl+3 shot 2"></p>
      <p>Using the initials of the words you are trying to find, you can narrow

    <td><p align="right"><b>Undo support for resource operations</b></td>
    <td>Undo and redo are now available for most resource
      changes. When you manipulate projects, folders, or files, you now have
      the ability to undo and redo the changes you have made. This includes resource
      creation, deletion, move, copy, and rename.  Use the <strong>Edit</strong> menu
      from the Navigator view to undo the operation. Note that operations from
      other views (such as the Java Package Explorer or Project Explorer) may not support undo.

  <tr> 
    <td><p align="right"><b>A new look</b></td>
    <td>Eclipse has a new default presentation. Some of the key features
    of this presentation are:
    <ul>
      <li>New Minimize/Maximize behavior. The new 'Minimize' behavior is to move the 
      view stack to the nearest trim area, showing a 'Restore' button along with the 
      icons for the views in the stack. When in the trim, clicking on a view icon will show 
      the view as a fast view. Minimized trays can be drag and dropped to new locations 
      along the workbench trim. Maximization of any stack triggers minimization of all others.
      Maximizing an editor now maximizes the entire editor area, allowing you to view
      multiple editors side-by-side while maximized.</li>
      <li>New workbench tab treatments. Workbench tabs have a new color
      scheme based on your system title background color, and unselected tabs
      now also have rounded corners to match the appearance of
      selected tabs. When tabs become crowded, they now maintain their icon and
      no longer show an ellipsis in order to maximize the amount of useful information.</li>
     </ul> 
      <p><img src="images/trim.png" alt="Trim"></p>
      <p>You can reinstate the old presentation via the <b>General &gt; Appearance</b> preference
        page.</p></td>

    <td valign="top">The resource selection dialog (<b>Navigate &gt; Open Resource</b>) 
    now allows you to filter based on working set, and supports camel-case search. 
    For example, searching with the string "TIMF" will match a file called "ThisIsMyFile". 
    <p> The dialog also now shows the history of recently opened items, and allows
    multi-selection to open several resources at once.

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>All plug-ins are now signed</b></td>

      signature provided by the Eclipse Foundation.  This allows you to authenticate that 
      the content you receive from the download server matches the content on 
      eclipse.org. Eclipse update manager will also authenticate the signatures on these

        currently open on the same file.</li>
        <li>Comparisons that used to take a long time now take a matter of seconds,
        thanks to a new text differencing algorithm.</li>
        <li>Compare editors are now initialized in the background so that the UI remains 
        responsive while the files are being fetched and compared.</li>
        <li>Many of your favorite editor commands are now available in compare editors,
        including find/replace, show whitespace characters, show line numbers, and the Show In

          to select how to run or debug the application. For example, when running 
          a JUnit test you can run as a Java application or JUnit test. A launch 
          configuration will be created and an entry will be added to the launch 
          history for the application.</p>
