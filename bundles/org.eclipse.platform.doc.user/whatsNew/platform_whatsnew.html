      <td> <p align="right"><b>Launch dialog</b></p></td>
      <td><p>A toolbar and name filter have been added to the launch dialog. The 
          toolbar provides actions to create, duplicate, delete, and collapse 
          all configurations, as well as manage the filters for the dialog. The 
          name filter dynamically filters entries in the dialog as you type to 
          show only those configurations matching the entered text, similar to 
          the preferences dialog.</p>

    <tr> 
      <td><div align="right"><b>Launch filters</b></div></td>
      <td><p>The launch dialog and launch history menu support a set of filters 
          that can be configured on the <strong>Run/Debug &gt; Launching &gt; 
          Launch Configurations</strong> preference page. You can filter configurations 
          from closed, deleted, or unavailable projects. As well, you can filter 
          specific kinds of configurations. The dialog and history menus optionally 
          support the current workbench window working sets.</p>
        <p><img src="images/lcd-filter-prefs.png"></p>
        <p>For resource based filtering to work, you need to migrate your existing 
          launch configurations. This can be done by pressing the <strong>Migrate</strong> 
          button on the preference page.</p>
        <p>The filters are also available for easy access in a new toolbar in 
          the launch dialog.</p>

          columns on/off use the view menu's <strong>Layout &gt; Show Columns</strong> 
          action. You can select the columns to be displayed using the <strong>Layout 
          &gt; Select Columns</strong> action. Recently changed variables are 
          displayed with a yellow background (controlled by the &quot;Changed 
          value background color&quot; user preference via the <strong>Run/Debug</strong> 
          preference page). The Java debugger supports editing of Strings and 
          primitive values inline.</p>
