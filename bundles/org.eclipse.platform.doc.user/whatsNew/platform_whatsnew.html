<h2>What's New in Mars</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or significant changes 
made to the Eclipse Platform for the Mars (4.5) release of Eclipse.</p>
<p>
Plug-in developers will also be interested in the corresponding 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/whatsNew/platform_isv_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
document in the plug-in developer's guide.</p>
<p>We also recommend to read the <a href="../tips/platform_tips.html">Tips and Tricks</a>.</p>

      When you copy/paste (<b>Ctrl+C</b> / <b>Ctrl+V</b>) a file onto itself to create a duplicate,
      the proposed new name is now just the old name followed by the digit 2 (or 3, etc., if that name is already taken).

          </p>
      <p>UI freezes longer than the warning threshold are logged to the Eclipse error log
      as warnings. The logged messages include one or more stack traces of the display
      thread. Longer UI freezes are logged as errors and include stack traces of all threads.
      Please keep in mind that capturing stack traces of all threads involves extra
      overhead, so setting the error threshold below 1 second is not recommended.</p>
      <p>A UI freeze is logged at the end of the freeze or after the deadlock threshold has
      expired, whichever comes first. The latter condition facilitates logging of indefinite
      UI freezes caused by deadlocks.</p>
      <p>Please file bugs for the UI freezes you encounter, describe what you were doing
      at the time, and include the messages from the error log related to the freeze.</p>

  <tr id="mru-tabs">
    <td class="title">"Visible tabs shown on overflow" behavior decoupled from appearance theme</td>
    <td class="content">
      In Eclipse 4.2, the non-"Classic" themes introduced a new strategy to select the editor tabs shown
      when there's not enough screen space to show all tabs. The new strategy shows a sliding
      window of tabs in their original opening sequence, cutting off tabs at the beginning and/or end of
      the full sequence.
      
      <p>In classic versions of Eclipse (before 4.2, and later with a "Classic" theme), the strategy
      was to show the most recently used tabs (MRU), i.e. the "working set" of tabs you're currently using.
      </p>
      
      <p>The coupling of behavior with styling (themes) was found to be problematic, and the
      tab visibility has has been turned into a separate preference. See
      <b>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Show most recently used tabs</b>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <img src="images/mru-preference.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      
      <p>
      By default, the option is <b>disabled</b>. Users of a "Classic" theme need to enable it manually
      to keep the behavior they're used to.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Plugin developers and Eclipse product owners can change via preferences whether
      the CSS theme or a user preference should control this option, and
      whether MRU should be enabled by default. The preferences are for the
      "org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt" plug-in, and the keys are:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      "MRUControlledByCSS" (default is "false"),
