<h2>What's New in 3.4</h2>

<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or significant changes 
made to the Eclipse Platform for the 3.4 release of Eclipse. They are grouped into:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Platform">Platform Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#Text">Editor Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#TeamCVS">Team/CVS Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#Debug">Debug Changes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Plug-in developers will also be interested in the corresponding 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/whatsNew/platform_isv_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
document in the plug-in developer's guide.

    <td>The UI for performing installation and updates
      is completely new in 3.4. The new UI is accessed using <b>Help &gt; Software Updates</b>.
      <p> <img src="images/p2ui.png" alt="Software Updates and Add-ons Dialog" title="Software Updates Dialog"> </p>
      <p>Unlike previous versions, you no longer have to find and select all prerequisites
        of the software you are trying to install. You can just select the single piece
        of software you want to install, and all prerequisites will be computed and installed automatically.
        The <b>Installed Software</b> tab only shows you the exact software items
        that you chose to install, rather than listing everything that is installed on your
        system. When you update software, all prerequisites of the software being updated
        will also be updated as needed.</p>
      <p>The new update dialog allows you to add update sites using drag and drop 
        gestures in addition to using the dialogs. To make an update site available in Eclipse, you can drag and drop a
        site URL link from supported browsers (such as Firefox) into the <b>Help &gt; Software
        Updates &gt; Available Software</b> page.</p>

          This means consistency with key bindings and the main window menu.</li>
        <li>Working sets as first class selection sources. For instance, if the
          Package Explorer view is showing working sets and the Problems view
          is filtering on selection, you will only see the problems in that working
          set.</li>

      location was automatically created with the given connection method and

      Now, the import process allows the user to fully configure the repository
      location, enabling them to specify a user name and change the connection
      method if require. So, for instance, a project set file containing extssh
      connections could now be used by a non-comitter since they could reconfigure
      the repository location connection method on import to be pserver.
