<h1>Performing builds manually</h1>

<P>By default, builds are performed automatically when you save resources. If 
  you need more control over when builds occur, you can disable automatic building 
  and manually invoke builds. This is sometimes desirable in cases where you know 
  building should wait until you finish a large set of changes. The disadvantage 
  of manual building is that tasks generated to indicate build errors quickly 
  become out of date until you build. In addition, it is very important that you 
  remember to manually build before relying on build output (for example, before 
  running your Java program).
</P>

<p><em>Note:</em> Some of the menu items described below are only available when 
the automatic build preference is disabled in the Workbench preferences (select 
<b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Workbench</b>).
</p>

<p>To build only selected projects:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Navigator view of the Resource perspective, select one or more projects.</li>
  <li>Right-click and select the option <b>Rebuild Project</b> from the pop-up menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>To build all projects in the workspace click <b>Project &gt; Rebuild All</b>. 
Note that, this will rebuild all resources, even the ones which have not been 
modified.
