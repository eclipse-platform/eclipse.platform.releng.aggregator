<h1>Performing builds manually</h1>

<P>By default, builds are performed automatically when you save resources. If 
  you need more control over when builds occur, you can disable automatic building 
  and manually invoke builds. This is sometimes desirable in cases where you know 
  building should wait until you finish a large set of changes. The disadvantage 
  of manual building is that tasks generated to indicate build errors quickly 
  become out of date until you build. In addition, it is very important that you 
  remember to manually build before relying on build output (for example, before 
  running your Java program).
</P>

<p><em>Note:</em> Some of the menu items described below are only available when 
the automatic build preference is disabled (ensure
<b>Project &gt; Build Automatically</b> is not checked).
</p>

<p>To build projects in the workspace select the projects and click <b>Project 
  &gt; Build Project</b>. Alternatively, click <b>Project &gt; Build All</b> to
  build all projects in the workspace. Both of these commands will search through
  the projects and only build the resources that have changed since the last build.
  To build all resources, even those that have not changed since the last build,
  run <b>Project &gt; Clean...</b> before doing the build.
