<H1>Resolving conflicts</H1>

<P>When updating or committing you may encounter conflicts. A conflict occurs 
  when you have locally modified a resource for which a more recent revision is 
  available in the branch in the repository. Specifically, the branch will contain 
  a revision newer than the base revision of your resource. In this situation 
  you can choose to do one of the following:
</P>

<ul>
  <li>You can take the change from the branch, discarding your local work. This 
    could occur if you have made unintended changes locally, or if you realize 
    that the revision in the repository is better than yours. Overwriting your 
    local changes should be done with caution since you are in essence throwing 
    work out.</li>
  <li>You can commit your change, subsuming the revision in the repository. This 
    should be done with great caution since you are in essence throwing away someone 
    else's work. In particular, the change you are overwriting may have other 
    dependencies in the branch (for example there may be other incoming changes 
    which depend on the conflict).</li>
  <li>You can merge your work and the repository resource, saving locally the 
    merged resource. You may then later choose to commit this merged result.</li>
</ul>

<P>Typically, you will want to take the third option, that is to merge, because 
  of the loss of work issues with the other two choices.
</P>

<h2><a name="MergingChanges">Manually merging changes</a></h2>

<P>The Synchronize View indicates those resources which are in conflict with the 
  branch. For a given resource in conflict, typically you will want to merge your 
  changes with changes in the branch's resource.
</P>

<P CLASS="Para">For example, let us assume that both you and another team member 
  have modified the same html page. Opening that resource from the Synchronize 
  view will display a comparison of the local resource and the branch revision. 
  By cycling through and merging the individual changes, you can decide for each 
  change whether to accept the incoming change, reject it, or merge it with your 
  local changes. When you are finished merging, you save your changes. This overwrites 
  your local resource with the result of the merge. You can subsequently commit 
  this merged resource. </P>

<P><em>Tip:</em> When merging changes, it is often convenient to be able to distinguish 
  which files you have completed merging. When you're done merging a file, you 
  can pick <b>Mark as Merged</b> from the context menu. This will change the status 
  of the file from being a conflict to being an outgoing change.
</P>

<P>You can merge differences in the Synchronization view on two levels:
</P>

<ul>
  <li><b>Whole Document</b> - In the Synchronize view, open the resource that 
    you want to merge in a Compare editor. In the Compare editor, click the Copy 
    all non-conflicting Changes from Right to Left button to copy all non-conflicting 
    changes. Conflicting changes will have to copied individually.</li>
  <li><b>Current Change</b> - In the Text Compare editor, either use the Go to 
    Next Difference and Go to Previous Difference buttons to navigate to the change 
    that you want to merge, or simply click in either source pane somewhere in 
    the desired change difference fragment. Click the Copy current change from 
    right to left button as needed to overwrite the highlighted fragment either 
    with the corresponding modification in the branch.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="AutoMergingChanges">Auto merging changes</a></h2>

<p>It is also possible to have your changes automatically merged for you. For 
  any resource marked as ASCII, performing a <b>Team &gt; Update</b> will automatically 
  merge into your local resource differences with the branch resource. This works 
  fine provided there are no lines with conflicting changes. If there are, CVS 
  inserts special markup in the file to indicate those lines which could not be 
  merged.
</p>

<p>Updating from within the Synchronization view works a bit differently. In the 
  case of a conflict, <strong>Update</strong> will only process files whose contents 
  contain no conflicts. Files that have content conflicts will be skipped and 
  left in the Synchronize view as conflicts.</p>
