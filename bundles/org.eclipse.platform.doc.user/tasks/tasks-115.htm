<H1>Synchronizing with the repository</H1>

<h3>Method 1: Using the context menu</h3>
<p>To synchronize resources in the Workbench with those in the repository: </p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Navigator view, select the resources that you want to synchronize.</li>
  <li>Right click and select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>. The 
    Synchronize view opens.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Method 2: Using the synchronize action</h3>
<ol>
  <li> From the Team Synchronizing perspective select the <strong>Synchronize...</strong> 
    action from the Synchronize <img src="../images/synch_participants.gif" alt="" border="0" width="16" height="16"> 
    button drop down.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>CVS</strong> from the list of possible synchronization types 
    and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the resource scope for the synchronize by either selecting Workspace, 
    Selected Resources or Working Set. Then select <strong>Finish.</strong></li>
  <li>The Synchronize view will open.</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Note</strong>: The synchronize action is not enabled by default in 
  other perspectives. You can enable the action to appear in your current perspective 
  by selecting <strong>Window &gt; Customize Perspective</strong>. Then click 
  on the <strong>Commands</strong> tab and check off <strong>Team</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If you choose the Workspace scope for your synchronization, you 
  can then use method 3 below to always have an up-to-date view of your local 
  modifications available in the Synchronize view without re-running the synchronize 
  operation. </p>
<h3>Method 3: Using a pinned CVS Workspace Synchronization in the Synchronize 
  view</h3>
<p>Once you have a CVS workspace synchronization in the Synchronize view, you 
  can pin it. This will prevent it from being replaced by the next CVS workspace 
  synchronization that is launched using one of the previous 2 methods. Here are 
  some of the advantages of using a pinned synchronization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The local modification state of the resources being synchronized is kept 
    up-to-date. This means that, if you modify a file locally that is within the 
    scope of a synchronization that appears in the Synchronize view, the resource 
    will appear automatically in the view, if it is not already there.</li>
  <li>The remote state of all of the resources being synchronized can be refreshed 
    using the Synchronize <img src="../images/synch_participants.gif" alt="" border="0" width="16" height="16"> 
    button in the toolbar of the Synchronize view.</li>
  <li>The remote state of a selection of resources can be refreshed using the 
    Synchronize command from the context menu in the Synchronize view.</li>
  <li>You can schedule the refreshing of the remote state to happen at particular 
    intervals (each hour, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>The implications of this is that you can see you outgoing resources without 
  re-fetching the remote state from the server (a potentially long running operation). 
  Also, the fetching of the remote state is run in the background so you can do 
  other things (e.g. inspect changes) while the remote state is fetched.</p>
<h3>From within the synchronize view</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use the toolbar buttons to switch modes for this view. There are four modes: 
    <ul>
      <li>Incoming mode - shows incoming changes only (resources in the repository 
        that differ from what is in the Workbench).</li>
      <li>Outgoing mode - shows outgoing changes only (resources modified in the 
        Workbench).</li>
      <li>Incoming/Outgoing mode - shows both incoming and outgoing changes.</li>
      <li>Conflicts mode = shows only conflicting resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Important:</em> It is preferable to update resources in the Workbench 
      first, resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then commit Workbench 
      resources to the repository.</li>
  <li>It is possible that someone has committed a new revision of your file since 
    you started working on it. This will result in a <em>conflict</em>, and care 
    must be taken to resolve this. For this reason, conflicts are shown in all 
    modes of the Synchronize view.</li>
</ol>
