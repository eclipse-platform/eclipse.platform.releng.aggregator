<H1 CLASS="Head">Filtering CVS Revisions in the History View</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">Over time, the revision history for a file can grow drastically. 
  As a result, it may be difficult to find the revision or revisions that you 
  are looking for. Using the filtering mechanism of the History View 
  can help.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">To set a filter on a CVS managed resource that is currently being displayed in the History View:</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select the <b>Filter...</b> action from the dropdown menu on the History View toolbar.</li>
  <li>Enter any branch, author, comment, or date range that you would like the view to display.
  <p><img src="../images/cvs_filter_res_history.png" alt="Filter Resource History dialog" border="0" ></p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The view will now display only those revisions that match the criteria you 
  entered.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can remove the filter at a later time by selecting <b>Remove Filters</b> from the dropdown menu on the History View toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can choose whether the filter should match any or all of the 
  criteria by selecting the appropriate radio button in the dialog.</p>
