<H1>Comparing resources with repository versions</H1>

<P>To compare Workbench resources with those in the repository:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a resource in one of the navigation views.</li>
  <li>From the resource's pop-up menu, select one of the following menu items: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Compare With &gt; Latest From &lt;Branch Name&gt;</b> or <strong>&lt;Version&gt;</strong>- 
        Compare the Workbench resource with the latest resources currently committed 
        to the branch that the local project is shared with or if the local project 
        is checked out as a version then compare against the version. A compare 
        editor will be opened. This editor will display a tree of all resource 
        differences between the workspace resource and the latest resources in 
        the repository.</li>
      <li><b>Compare With &gt; Another Branch or Version</b> - Compare the Workbench 
        resource with a specific version or branch that you select in the repository. 
        A compare editor will be opened. The editor will display a tree of all 
        resource differences between the workspace resource and the resources 
        in the specified version or branch.</li>
      <li><b>Compare With &gt; History...</b> - (available only on a file) Compare 
        the Workbench file with another revision of the file. Based on your preference 
        settings, either the History view or a dialog will open. The History view (or dialog)
        will contain a table of all available revisions 
        of the selected file. Selecting one of the revisions will show the differences 
        between the workspace revision and the selected revision. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tip</em>: When comparing with a branch or version, you can specify a particular 
  date instead of a version or branch tag. This can be done by right clicking 
  on the <strong>Dates</strong> category in the tag selection list and choosing 
  <strong>Add Date</strong>. A Date Tag dialog is displayed that allows you to 
  specify a date and optionally a time. After you click <strong>Ok</strong>, the 
  date tag will appear in the tag selection list.</p>
