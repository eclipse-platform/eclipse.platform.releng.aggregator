<h1 class="Head">Connecting and configuring CVS with SSH<br>
</h1>
<p>Eclipse includes an SSH client for accessing a remote CVS server.
The
client supports both the SSH1 and SSH2 protocol versions. To use SSH2
with a CVS repository select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">extssh</span>
connection type. </p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> Different methods can be
used to authenticate, depending on the level of functionality and
security you want. User authentication methods used by the client by
default are, in the following order: public-key, Keyboard-Interactive,
and password authentication.<br>
</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Authentication with Public
Keys (keypair)<br>
</font></h3>
<p>
Public-key authentication allows you to connect to a remote CVS server
without sending your password over the wire. This is a more secure
authentication method than password authentication. Public-key
authentication uses two keys, a private key that only you have--it
should be kept in a secure place and protected with a password. And the
public key, which is placed on the server you wish to gain access to.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tip</span>: If you are interested in
more information about the&nbsp; keypair authentication you can read <a
 href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc?t=gr,p=RSA-DSA">this</a>.<br>
<br>
Eclipse supports generating both keys and you can copy the public key
to the server from within Eclipse. In order to use public key
authentication follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you already have a private/public key for the CVS server,
simply open the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Team &gt; CVS
&gt;&nbsp; SSH2 Connection Method</span> preference page and on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">General </span>tab add your private key to
the list by selecting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Private
Key</span> button. Your key will b used when authenticating.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don't have a keypair yet, in the preferences page goto
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Key Management</span> page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select either a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate RSA
key</span>
(if your server supports version 1 of the protocol) or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Generate DSA key</span> (for version 2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A public key and private key will be generated. The public key
will be shown in the read-only text area. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step is to copy the public key to your server. If your
server is running an OpenSSH server than you can use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Export via sftp</span> action. Otherwise
you will have to copy and paste the public key into your remote
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you have to provide a password for your private key, and
save
it on your computer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>So now that you have your keypairs generated and installed, the next
time you create a CVS location to the server you shouldn't enter a
password. When the connection is initialized, you will be prompted for
the passphrase for your private key. This is the most secure method of
authentication, as long as your private key is protected with a
passphrase.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: exporting the public key
is only supported on OpenSSH enabled SSH servers.</p>
<h3>Authentication with Passwords</h3>
<p>
If your server is configured to support password authentication, then
you can simply enter your password when you create a CVS repository
location and that password will be used when authenticating with the
server. This is the simplest authentication method, but isn't as secure
as public keys.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: It is not recommended
that you save your login passwords using Eclipse. The file that
contains the file is not sufficiently protected against intruders and
as such you can comprise the security of your system. If your company
requires strict security pratices then your should use keypair
authentication.</p>
