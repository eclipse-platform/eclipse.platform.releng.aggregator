<H1 CLASS="Head">Authoring the CVS .cvsignore file</H1>

<P>When committing resources, often there are resources that you do not want to 
  add to version control. One way you can do this is by using the CVS &quot;ignore&quot; 
  facility, which reads the contents of the file <i>.cvsignore</i> to determine 
  what to ignore.</P>

<P>The <i>.cvsignore</i> file can be added to any directory of a project. Many 
  existing CVS projects already contain several of these files. This text file 
  consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns.
</P>

<P>For example, to add a .cvsignore file to ignore the entire bin directory of
  an existing project:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select a project that contains a /bin directory. 
    The bin directory will commonly contain the projects build output. These are 
    files that are generated from the project's source files and are usually not 
    version-controlled.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu for the project, select <b> New &gt; File</b>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Type <i>.</i><samp>cvsignore</samp> as the file name, then press <b>Finish</b>. 
    The file will be created in your project's root directory. You should see 
    it in one of the navigation views.</li>
  <li>Enter <samp>bin</samp> in the .cvsignore file and save it.</li>
  <li>Select the project.&nbsp; From the context menu, select the <b> Team &gt; 
    Synchronize with Repository</b> menu item.&nbsp; Notice that the bin directory 
    does not show as an outgoing change. It is ignored.</li>
</ol>

<P>The cvsignore file consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns. 
  In a similar way to the global ignore facility, the wildcards * and ? may be 
  present in any entry in the .cvsignore file. Any file or sub-directory 
  <i>in the current directory</i> that matches any one of the patterns will 
  be ignored.
</P>

<p><b>Tip:</b> In the Team menu and in the Synchronize view resource context menu there is a menu item (<b>Add to .cvsignore</b>)
for adding a file pattern
to the appropriate .cvsignore file. This menu item is enabled for resources that are not yet under CVS version
control.
