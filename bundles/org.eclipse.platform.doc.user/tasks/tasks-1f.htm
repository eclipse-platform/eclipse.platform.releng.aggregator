<H1>Working with local history</H1>

<p>A local edit history of a file is maintained when you create or modify a file. 
Each time you edit and save the file, a copy is saved so that you can replace 
the current file with a previous edit or even restore a deleted file.
You can also compare the contents of 
all the local edits. Each edit in the local history is uniquely represented 
by the date and time the file was saved. See the Related tasks links for more
details.
