<h1>Running Eclipse</h1>
<!-- ************* BEGIN SECTION COPIED FROM README FILE **************** -->
<p>After installing the Eclipse SDK in a directory, you can start the Workbench
by running the Eclipse executable included with the release (you also need a 1.4.2
JRE, not included with the Eclipse SDK). On Windows, the executable file is called <samp>eclipse.exe</samp>,
and is located in the <code>eclipse</code> sub-directory of the install. If
installed at <code>c:\eclipse-SDK-3.6-win32</code>, the executable is <code>c:\eclipse-SDK-3.6-win32\eclipse\eclipse.exe</code>.

<b>Note:</b> Set-up on most other operating environments is analogous. Special
instructions for Mac OS X are listed <a href="#macosx">below</a>.</p>

<h3>Allocating enough memory and solving OutOfMemoryErrors</h3>
<p>By default, Eclipse will allocate up to 384 megabytes of Java heap memory. This should
be ample for all typical development tasks. However, depending on the JRE
that you are running, the number of additional plug-ins you are using, and
the number of files you will be working with, you could conceivably have to increase this amount. 
Eclipse allows you to pass arguments directly to the Java VM using the
<code>-vmargs</code> command line argument, which must follow all other Eclipse specific arguments.
Thus, to increase the available heap memory, you would typically use:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>eclipse -vmargs -Xmx&lt;memory size&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the <code>&lt;memory size&gt;</code> value set to greater than
&quot;384M&quot; (384 megabytes -- the default). 
</p>
<p>
When using an Oracle (Sun) VM, you may also need to increase the size of the permanent
generation memory.  The default maximum is 64 megabytes, but more may
be needed depending on your plug-in configuration and use.  When the VM runs
out of permanent generation memory, it may crash or hang during class loading.
This failure is less common when using Sun JRE version 1.5.0_07 or greater.
The maximum permanent generation size is increased using the -XX:MaxPermSize=&lt;memory size&gt; argument:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>eclipse -vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=&lt;memory size&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument may not be available for all VM versions and platforms; consult your VM documentation
for more details.
</p>
<p>
Note that setting memory sizes to be larger than the amount of available physical
memory on your machine will cause Java to &quot;thrash&quot; as it copies objects
back and forth to virtual memory, which will severely degrade your performance.
</p>
<h3>Selecting a workspace</h3>
<p>When the Workbench is launched, the first thing you see is a 
dialog that allows you to select where the workspace will be located. The
workspace is the directory where your work will be stored.
If you do not specify otherwise, Eclipse creates the workspace in your
user directory.
This workspace directory is used as the default content area for your projects
as well as for holding any required metadata. For shared or multi-workspace
installs you must explicitly specify the location for your workspace using the
dialog (or via the &quot;<code>-data</code>&quot; command line argument).</p>
<h3>Specifying the Java virtual machine</h3>
<p>Here is a typical Eclipse command line:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>eclipse -vm c:\jdk1.4.2\jre\bin\javaw</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Tip:</i> It's generally a good idea to explicitly specify which Java VM to
use when running Eclipse. This is achieved with the &quot;<code>-vm</code>&quot;
command line argument as illustrated above. If you don't use &quot;<code>-vm</code>&quot;,
Eclipse will look on the O/S path. When you install other Java-based products,
they may change your path and could result in a different Java VM being used
when you next launch Eclipse.</p>
<p>To create a Windows shortcut to an installed Eclipse:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <code>eclipse.exe</code> in Windows Explorer and use Create
    Shortcut on the content menu.</li>
  <li>Select the shortcut and edit its Properties. In the Target: field append
    the command line arguments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opening this shortcut launches Eclipse. (You can drag the shortcut to the 
Windows Desktop if you want to keep it in easy reach.)</p>

<h3><a name="macosx">Mac OS X</a></h3>
<p>On Mac OS X, you start Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse application. If you need to 
pass arguments to Eclipse, you'll have to edit the <code>eclipse.ini</code> file
inside the Eclipse application bundle: select the Eclipse application bundle icon while holding down the Control Key.
This will present you with a popup menu. Select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; in the popup menu.
Locate <code>eclipse.ini</code> file in the <code>Contents/MacOS</code> sub-folder and open it with your favorite text editor to edit the command line options.
</p>

<p>
On MacOS X you can only launch a UI program more than once if you have separate
copies of the program on disk. The reason for this behavior is that every UI
application on Mac can open multiple documents, so typically there is no need
to open a program twice. Since Eclipse cannot open more than one workspace, this means you have to make
a copy of the Eclipse install if you want to open more then one workspace at
the same time (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=139319">139319</a>).
</p>

<p>If you need to launch Eclipse from the command line, you can use the symbolic link &quot;eclipse&quot; in the
top-level eclipse folder. It refers to the eclipse executable inside the application bundle and takes
the same arguments as &quot;eclipse.exe&quot; on other platforms. 
</p>
<p>On Mac OS X 10.4 and later, you may notice a slow down when working with significant
numbers of resources if you allow Spotlight to index your workspace. To prevent this, start
System Preferences, select the Spotlight icon, then the Privacy tab, then click the Add button
(&quot;+&quot;) and find your workspace directory in the dialog that appears.</p>
<h3><a name="SharedInstall">Shared Install</a></h3>
<p>The startup speed of a shared install can be improved if proper cache information is stored in the shared 
install area. To achieve this, after unzipping Eclipse distribution, run Eclipse once with the &quot;-initialize&quot; 
option from an account that has a write access to the install directory.</p>

<h1>Advanced Topics in Running Eclipse </h1>

<p>The Eclipse executable and the platform itself offer a number of execution 
  options of interest to people developing or debugging parts of Eclipse. This 
  is a list of the commonly used options, for a full list see the Eclipse runtime 
  options page in the Platform Plug-in Developer Guide. The general form of running 
  the Eclipse executable is:</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>eclipse [platform options] [-vmargs [Java VM arguments]]</pre>
