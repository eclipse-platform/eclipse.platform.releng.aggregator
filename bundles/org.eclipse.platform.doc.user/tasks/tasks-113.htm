<P>While you are working on a project in the Workbench, other members of your 
  team may be committing changes to the copy of the project in the repository. 
  To get these changes, you may &quot;update&quot; your Workbench to match the 
  state of the branch. The changes you will see will be specific to the branch 
  that your Workbench project is configured to share. You control when you choose 
  to update.
</P>

<p>The update command can be issued from two places: the <b>Team &gt; Update</b> 
  menu, or the <b>Synchronize</b> view. In order to understand the difference 
  between these two commands, it is important to know about the three different 
  kinds of incoming changes.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <i>non-conflicting</i> change occurs when a file has been changed remotely 
    but has not been modified locally.</li>
  <li>An <i>auto-mergeable conflicting</i> change occurs when an ASCII file has 
    been changed both remotely and locally (i.e. has non-committed local changes) 
    but the changes are on different lines.</li>
  <li>A <i>non-auto-mergeable conflicting</i> change occurs when one or more of 
    the same lines of an ASCII file or when a binary file has been changed both 
    remotely and locally (binary files are never auto-mergeable).</li>
</ul>

<p>When you select <b>Team &gt; Update</b>, the contents of the local resources 
  will be updated with incoming changes of all of the above three types. You can specify what
  the update behaviour should be in the
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.UpdateMergePreferences)")'>
    <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
  <b>Team &gt; CVS &gt; Update/Merge</b></a>
  preference page. The choices are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Preview all incoming changes before Updating</b>: All changes will be displayed in either the Sync View or 
  a dialog (depending on your settings). You can then merge each change in line by line, or update all non-conflicting
  changes at once and then deal with the remaining conflicts.</li>
  
  <li><b>Update all non-conflicting changes and then preview the remaining changes</b>: All
  non-conflicting incoming changes will be merged in automatically and any remaining conflicts will be
  displayed either in the Sync View (<em>default</em>) or in a dialog. You can specify where to display conflicts
  from the Update/Merge preference page. </li>
   
  <li><b>Never preview and use CVS text markup to indicate conflicts (<em>default</em>)</b>: This option will automatically
  merge all changes in without any user interaction. Conflicting changes will be merged in using the CVS text markup:<br>
  	<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; original file revision
  	<br>[original code]
  	<br>= = = = = = =
  	<br>[incoming code]
  	<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; incoming file revision<br>
  
   <br>You will then have to go in to each file that contains a merge conflict and edit the file to the desired final state.
  </li>
  </ul>
 <p>
  It is often desirable to know what incoming changes there are before updating any local resources. These issues are addressed by 
  the Synchronize view.
</p>

<p>To open the Synchronize view in incoming mode:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources which you want to update.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu for the selected resources, select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize 
    with Repository</b>. The Synchronize view will open.</li>
  <li>On the toolbar of the Synchronize View, click the <b> Incoming mode</b> 
    button to filter out any modified Workbench resources (outgoing changes) that 
    you may have.</li>
</ol>

<p>In incoming mode, you will see changes that have been committed to the branch 
  since you last updated. The view will indicate the type of each incoming change. 
  There are two update commands (available from the context menu of any resource 
  in the view) to deal with the different types of conflicts: <b>Update</b> and 
  <b>Override and Update</b>. When you select the <b>Update</b> command in the 
  Synchronize view, all selected incoming and auto-mergeable conflicting changes 
  are processed while conflicts that are not auto-mergeable will not be updated 
  (any files that have been successfully processed are removed from the view). 
  The <b>Override and Update</b> command operates on conflicts and will replace 
  the local resources with the remote contents. This &quot;replace&quot; behavior 
  is rarely what is desired. An alternative is described later. </p>

<p>To update non-conflicting and auto-mergeable files:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Structure Compare pane at the top of the Synchronize view contains the 
    hierarchy of resources with incoming changes.</li>
  <li>Select all conflicting files and choose <b>Update </b> from the pop-up menu. 
    This will update the selected resources that are either incoming changes or 
    auto-mergeable conflicts and remove them from the view. Conflicts whose contents 
    are not auto-mergeable will be left in the view.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your local Workbench contains any outgoing changes that are not auto-mergeable 
  with incoming changes from the branch, then, instead of performing an <b>Override 
  and Update</b>, you can merge the differences into your Workbench manually, 
  as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Structure Compare pane, if there is a conflict in the resource list 
    (represented by red arrows), open it (either by double-clicking or selecting 
    <strong>Open in Compare Editor</strong> from the context menu).</li>
  <li>In the Text Compare area of the compare editor, local Workbench data is 
    represented on the left, and repository branch data is represented on the 
    right. Examine the differences between the two.</li>
  <li>Use the text compare area to merge any changes. You can copy changes from 
    the repository revision of the file to the Workbench copy of the file and 
    save the merged Workbench file (using the pop-up menu in the left pane).</li>
  <li>Once you are completed merging the remote changes into a local file, choose 
    <b>Mark as Merged</b> from the pop-up menu in the Synchronize view. This will 
    mark the local file as having been updated and allow your changes to be committed.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> The repository contents are not changed when you update. When 
  you accept incoming changes, these changes are applied to your Workbench. The 
  repository is only changed when you commit your outgoing changes.
</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> In the Synchronize view, selecting an ancestor of a set of incoming 
  changes will perform the operation on all the appropriate children. For instance, 
  selecting the top-most folder and choosing <b>Update </b> will process all incoming 
  and auto-mergeable conflicting changes and leave all other incoming changes unprocessed. 
</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> The behavior of the <b>Override and Update</b> command described 
  above only applies to the incoming mode of the Synchronize view. In the <b>Incoming/Outgoing 
  mode</b> of the view, the behavior for incoming changes and conflicts is the 
  same but the command will revert outgoing changes to whatever the repository 
  contents are. Exercise great caution if using this command in Incoming/Outgoing 
  mode. </p>
