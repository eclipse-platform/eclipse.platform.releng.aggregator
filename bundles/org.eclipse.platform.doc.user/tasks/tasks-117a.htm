<H1>Project checked out with another CVS tool</H1>

<P CLASS="Para">It is possible to use a CVS project checked out using another 
  CVS tool into Eclipse. A common concern for those migrating to Eclipse is that 
  they already have their CVS project checked out on their local machine. You 
  <em>don't</em> have to check out the contents again to create a project in Eclipse. 
  When such a project is imported into Eclipse, the CVS plug-in may detect that 
  CVS folders exist and auto-share the project. However, there are some instance 
  were this does not occur and the project will need to be shared manually within 
  Eclipse in order to enable the CVS Team menu operations.</P>
<P>To share an CVS project that was already checked out:</P>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the project to be shared.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Team &gt;</b> <b>Share Project...</b> from the project's pop-up 
    menu. The Share Project wizard opens.</li>
  <li>From the list of available repository providers, choose <b>CVS</b> and click 
    <b>Next </b>to go to the next page. (<b>Note</b>: If CVS is not present in 
    the list, it may be disabled. Clicking on the <strong>Show All Wizards</strong> 
    button should make it visible.)</li>
  <li>The next page displays the sharing information stored in the CVS folder 
    of the project. Click <strong>Finish</strong> to share the project and enable 
    the CVS Team menu operations.</li>
</ol>
