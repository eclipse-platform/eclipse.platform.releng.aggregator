<H1>Building resources</H1>

<p>There are a number of ways that resources in the Workbench can be built. The 
scope of a build can be one or more selected projects, a working set, or the entire workspace. 
</p>

<p>A build will typically only operate on resources that have changed since
the last build.  A clean build will discard all existing built state, causing the
next build to operate on all resources within the scope of the build.</p>

<p>Builds can be done automatically (each time resources are modified), or manually, 
using a menu item or keyboard shortcut. See the Related tasks links for more details.
