<h1 class="Head">Determining who last modified a line with the Annotate command</h1>
<p>Let's say you have found some code that you don't understand on line 65 of a file. 
  Who do you ask about it?  Well you could start by 
  looking at the resource history for the file, but that won't tell you who changed 
  that particular line. This is why the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Annotate</span> command is useful. 
  Sometimes jokingly referred to as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">blame</span>, 
  it allows you to pick any 
  ASCII file (see note on binary files) and get a listing of who changed what 
  line. </p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Team &gt; Show Annotation</span> action
is available from the following places: History View, Repository Explorer,
Synchronize View, the Project and Package Explorers, and text editor context menus. The action works in a Quick Diff
flavor and offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays the annotations on a local file right in the same editor.</li>
  <li>Clicking on an annotation or clicking on any line in the editor will prompt the
    History View to show the corresponding revision information.</li>
  <li>Doesn't lose your place in the editor when displaying the annotation; simply adds the
    annotations to the annotation bar of the editor that you are currently using.</li>
  <li>To turn off annotations, you have to select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revisions &gt; Hide Revision Information</span> from the annotation
    bar context menu.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Only works with text files</h2>
<p>The annotate command will only work with files that are marked as ASCII in 
  the CVS repository. Also, the command will open a text file to show the changes 
  even if the associated editor in the workbench is a non-text editor. For example, 
  if you run annotate on a plugin.xml file a simple text editor will be opened 
  instead of the full PDE editor.</p>
