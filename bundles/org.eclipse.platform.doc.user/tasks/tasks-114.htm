<H1 CLASS="Head">Committing</H1>

<P>You can commit Workbench resources that you have modified to the repository 
  so that other team members can see your work. Only those changes committed on 
  that branch will be visible to others working on that branch. The commit command 
  can be issued from two places: the <b>Team &gt; Commit</b> menu, or the <b>Synchronize</b>
  view.
</p>

<h2>Committing changes using <b>Team &gt; Commit</b></h2>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to commit.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the resources and select <b>Team &gt; Commit</b> from the 
    pop-up menu.</li>
  <li>If there are new files whose file types cannot be determined automatically, 
    the first page of the Commit dialog will present the unknown types and allow 
    you to set them appropriately to either ASCII or binary. Click <strong>Next</strong> 
    to continue.</li>
  <li>On the Comment page, provide a comment for your changes (for example, <samp>Fixed 
    the spelling mistakes</samp>).</li>
</ol>

<P>You can preview files that are about to be committed from the Comment page.
  If any of the files are known to be conflicting changes, the commit 
  will not be allowed. If there are no known conflicting changes the commit will 
  be allowed but there could still be conflicting changes on the server (i.e. 
  conflicting changes on the server become known to the client during a synchronize 
  operation). If there are conflicting changes on any files that are committed, 
  the operation will fail. If this occurs, you must either perform an update or 
  use the Synchronize view to resolve the conflicts. It is considered a more ideal 
  workflow to always update before committing in order to ensure that you have 
  the latest state of the repository before committing more changes. </p>
<P>If one or more of the resources being committed are new and not yet added to 
  CVS control, they will be added automatically unless they are explicitly removed 
  by choosing <strong>Remove from View</strong> from the context menu.</p>

<h2>Committing changes in the Synchronize view</h2>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to commit.</li>
  <li>Right-click to open the pop-up menu and select <b> Team &gt; Synchronize 
    with Repository</b>. The Synchronize view will open.</li>
  <li>On the toolbar of the Synchronize view, select the <b>Outgoing mode</b> 
    button to show any modified Workbench resources (outgoing changes) that you 
    may have.</li>
  <li>If there are conflicts (red arrows), resolve them. To do so open them in 
    a Compare editor and use the text compare area to merge resources with conflicts. 
    You can copy changes from the repository revision of the file to the Workbench 
    revision of the file and save the merged Workbench resource. Once all the 
    conflicts in the Structure Compare area have been resolved, perform a <strong>Mark 
    as Merged</strong> on the resource in the Synchronize view to make the change 
    an outgoing change and you are ready to commit.</li>
  <li>In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the top of the hierarchy that 
    you want to commit, and select <b>Commit</b> from the pop-up menu.</li>
  <li>In the Commit Comment dialog box, provide a comment for your changes (for 
    example, <samp>Fixed the spelling mistakes</samp>). Again, if there are new 
    files of an unknown type, you will be asked to specify what type they should 
    be. </li>
</ol>

<P><em>Tip:</em> You can commit files that are in conflict by performing an <b>Override 
  and Commit</b>. This will commit the Workbench copy of the resource into the 
  repository and thus remove any of the incoming changes.
</p>

<P><em>Warning:</em> The behavior of the <b>Override and Commit</b> command described 
  above only applies to the outgoing mode of the Synchronize view. In the <b>Incoming/Outgoing 
  mode</b> of the view, the behavior for outgoing changes and conflicts is the 
  same but the command will revert incoming changes to whatever the local Workbench 
  contents are. Exercise great caution if using this command in incoming/outgoing 
  mode. </p>
