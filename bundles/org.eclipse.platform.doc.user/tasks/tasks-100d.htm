<H1 CLASS="Head">Version control life cycle: adding and ignoring resources</H1>

<p>When committing resources, often there are resources that you do not want to 
  store in the repository. For example, external editors might create temporary 
  files in your project, compilation of .java files might create .class files, 
  or some build operations might result in binary files. When put together, these 
  generated files may be quite large. They may also be regenerated whenever 
  a build is performed, resulting in many outgoing changes. Typically these are 
  not files that one wants to persist in the repository or to share with other 
  members of a team.
</p>

<p>Team CVS has two related tasks that allow you to control which files are stored 
  in the repository: adding a resource to version control, and ignoring a resource. 
</p>
  
<h2>Adding a file to version control</h2>

<p>Team CVS does not automatically add files to version control. Rather, it's 
  your choice to explicitly add files to version control. This is accomplished 
  by selecting the <b>Team &gt; Add to Version Control</b> menu.
</p>

<p>When performed on a file, it will add that file to version control. The result 
  is that the CVS repository immediately creates an entry so that it can 
  start maintaining history state for that file. This occurs even before you commit 
  the file to the repository.
</p>

<p>When adding a folder or project, the action will recursively descend into sub-folders, 
  adding those files it finds to version control, provided the files have not 
  been explicitly ignored. </p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> When committing files, if the selection either directly or recursively 
  contains files which have not been added to version control, you will be prompted 
  whether or not you want them added. This is a convenience function to help ensure 
  that you do not miss committing new resources which were unintentionally never 
  added. </p>

<h2><i>How may I ignore thee, let me count the ways</i></h2>

<P>There are several facilities that allow you to specify which resources should 
  be excluded from version control:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>There is a global preference which you can use for ignoring files and directories 
    that match a certain filename pattern. For example, if you create a global 
    ignore for <samp>/bin</samp>, and any resource that matches &quot;bin&quot; 
    in any directory in the workspace will be ignored for version control. Use the
    <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.team.ui.IgnorePreferences)")'>
    <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
    <b>Team &gt; Ignored Resources</b></a>
    preference page to globally exclude resources from version control.</li>
  <li>Any resource marked as <i>derived</i> will be automatically ignored for 
    version management by Team CVS. Some builders, such as the Java builder, mark 
    all of its build output (e.g. .class files) as derived.</li>
  <li>CVS supports the creation of a special <i>.cvsignore</i> file whose contents 
    describe which files or folders to ignore for version management. The .cvsignore 
    file only applies the pattern to resources in the <i> same</i> directory as 
    the .cvsignore file itself.</li>
</ol>

<P><em>Tip</em>: Once a resource is under version control, it cannot be 
  subsequently ignored easily. This is why you must invoke an explicit command 
  to add resources to version control.
