<H1>Restoring deleted files from the repository</H1>

<P>The CVS plug-in allows you to delete files from the CVS repository. If you 
  delete a managed file and commit the deletion to the server, the file is deleted 
  from the current branch or version. Although the file has been deleted from 
  the current branch, the file and its previous revisions are actually still on 
  the server. The CVS plug-in provides a tool to help restore a file to your workspace 
  that has previously been deleted from the CVS repository:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a folder managed by CVS and from the context menu select <strong>Team 
    &gt; Restore from Repository</strong>.</li> 
  <li>The repository will be searched for deleted files and the list will be shown 
    in a dialog.</li> 
  <li>Select a file in the left most pane to display the revisions of the file 
    that are available in the repository.</li>
  <li>Select a revision in the right-most pane to view the contents in the bottom 
    text pane.</li>
  <li>Check the revision that you would like to restore.</li> 
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> once you have checked off a revision for each 
    file you wish to restore.</li>
  <li>After restoring the file if you want to actually restore the file to the 
    current branch you have to add then commit the file back into the repository. 
    If the filename does not change, revision history will be maintained for the 
    restored file.</li> 
</ol>
