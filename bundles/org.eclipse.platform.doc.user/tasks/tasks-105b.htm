<H1>Reverting a branch to a previous version</H1>
<p>
It is often useful to revert the contents of a branch to those of a specific version. For example, if your current branch contains changes that you no longer want to release you can revert all or a portion of a project to the contents of any version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checkout into your workspace the contents from the branch that you want 
    to revert. </li>
  <li>Select <strong>Compare With &gt; Another Branch or Version</strong> on the 
    resource(s) that you want to revert. </li>
  <li>From the tag selection dialog box select the version to which you want to 
    revert the branch.</li>
  <li>When the compare editor opens, review the differences that are shown and 
    ensure that they are what you expected. </li>
  <li>Select the root folder in the compare view and from the context menu select 
    <strong>Override and Update</strong>. After the operation is completed the 
    folder or project you compared against will have exactly the same contents 
    as the remote revision. </li>
  <li>You can verify this by performing another comparison against the version. 
    (<strong>Note</strong>: That the CVS preference to <strong>Consider file contents 
    in remote comparisons</strong> in the

    <b>Team &gt; CVS &gt; Synchronize/Compare</b></a>
    preference page should be enabled for this to work.) </li>
  <li>The comparison should report that there are no changes.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Head">Once your workspace contains the new contents, run your tests 
  then commit the changes to the branch.</p>
