<P>You can filter the tasks or problems that are displayed in the Tasks or Problems 
  views. For example, you might wish to see only problems that have been logged 
  by the Workbench, or tasks that you have logged as reminders to yourself. You 
  can filter items according to which resource or group of resources they are 
  associated with, by text string within the Description field, by problem severity, 
  by task priority, or by task status. </P>
