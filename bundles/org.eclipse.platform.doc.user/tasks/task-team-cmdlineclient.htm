<H1 CLASS="Head">Running the CVS command-line client outside of Eclipse</H1>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Because the Eclipse CVS plug-in stores its meta information in a format that 
  is compatible with the command-line CVS client you should be able to use a CVS 
  command line client against Eclipse workspace files on disk. The metadata is 
  stored in CVS/ sub-directories but you rarely see them within Eclipse. They are 
  marked as private which causes them to be hidden from view. If you open a (non-Eclipse) 
  file explorer you will see that these directories and their contents appear 
  on the file system.</p>
<h2> Don't forget to refresh!</h2>


<p>Whenever you use external tools to modify workspace files, you must perform 
  a <strong>Refresh</strong> from within Eclipse to make the workspace aware of 
  the changes. If you get a <em>resource out of sync</em> error in Eclipse it 
  is a sign that there are resources in Eclipse that have been modified outside 
  of Eclipse. One solution is to perform a refresh (available from a resource's 
  popup menu) on any resources or projects that where modified outside of Eclipse. 
  There is also a preference to refresh automatically.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p><strong>1. Deleted folders</strong></p>
<p>You may encounter unexpected behavior when using the command-line CVS client 
  in conjunction with deleted folders. Eclipse's CVS support keeps track of deleted 
  folders and their contents so that, on the next synchronization, the Synchronize 
  view can properly report on the changes. This information is kept outside of 
  the CVS meta folder structure. This is because in CVS you normally inform the 
  repository of deletions prior to deleting them locally, which is a different 
  workflow than we like to support in the Synchronization view. Thus it is recommended 
  that you do not use the command-line CVS client while you have pending deletions 
  to commit. In some circumstances it could cause the Synchronize view to display 
  incorrect contents, although it will not cause any lost work. </p>
<p><strong>2. CVS directories appear in the workbench</strong></p>
<p>When you use the command-line CVS the CVS folders can sometimes appear 
  in one of the navigation views. There are some cases where CVS folders are not hidden from the 
  UI as you would expect. For instance, CVS folders will appear if a user 
  imports a CVS project into Eclipse before the CVS plug-in is loaded. To avoid 
  this, open the CVS Repositories view (thus loading the CVS plug-in) before importing 
  CVS projects into Eclipse. </p>
<p><strong>3. The 'extssh' connection method</strong></p>
<p>The <em>extssh</em> connection method is unique to Eclipse CVS and doesn't 
  exist in the command-line CVS client. If you are using <em>extssh</em> to connect 
  to a SSH2 repository and would like to use the command line client for some 
  CVS operations you can configure the <em>ext</em> connection method to use <em>extssh</em> 
  when inside Eclipse.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new repository location that uses the <em>ext</em> connection method. 
    The repository path, host, and user should be identical to those in the <em>extssh</em> 
    location.</li>
  <li>Open the
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.ExtMethodPreferencePage)")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="command link">
  <strong>Team &gt; CVS &gt; Ext Connection Method</strong></a> preference page.</li>
  <li>Enable<strong> Use another connection method type to connect</strong> and 
    choose <em>extssh</em>.</li>
  <li>Now when you use the <em>ext</em> connection method inside Eclipse, <em>extssh</em> 
    will be used instead of an external client.</li>
