<H1 CLASS="Head">Running the CVS command-line client outside of Eclipse</H1>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>Because the Eclipse CVS plug-in stores its meta information in a format that 
  is compatible with the command-line CVS client you should be able to use a CVS 
  command line client against Eclipse workspace files on disk. The metadata is 
  stored in CVS/ sub-directories but you rarely see them within Eclipse. They are 
  marked as private which causes them to be hidden from view. If you open a (non-Eclipse) 
  file explorer you will see that these directories and their contents appear 
  on the file system.</p>
<h3> Don't forget to refresh!</h3>


<p>Whenever you use external tools to modify workspace files, you must perform 
  a <strong>Refresh</strong> from within Eclipse to make the workspace aware of 
  the changes. If you get a <em>resource out of sync</em> error in Eclipse it 
  is a sign that there are resources in Eclipse that have been modified outside 
  of Eclipse. One solution is to perform a refresh (available from a resource's 
  popup menu) on any resources or projects that where modified outside of Eclipse. 
  There is also an <em>auto-refresh</em> plug-in available from <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/dev.html">Platform 
  Core</a> web site.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p><strong>1. Deleted folders</strong></p>
<p>You may encounter unexpected behavior when using the command-line CVS client 
  in conjunction with deleted folders. Eclipse's CVS support keeps track of deleted 
  folders and their contents so that, on the next synchronization, the Synchronize 
  view can properly report on the changes. This information is kept outside of 
  the CVS meta folder structure. This is because in CVS you normally inform the 
  repository of deletions prior to deleting them locally, which is a different 
  workflow than we like to support in the Synchronization view. Thus it is recommended 
  that you do not use the command-line CVS client while you have pending deletions 
  to commit. In some circumstances it could cause the Synchronize view to display 
  incorrect contents, although it will not cause any lost work. </p>
<p><strong>2. CVS directories appear in the workbench</strong></p>
<p>When you use the command-line CVS the CVS folders can sometimes appear in the 
  Navigator View. There are some cases where CVS folders are not hidden from the 
  UI as the user would expect. For instance, CVS folders will appear if a user 
  imports a CVS project into Eclipse before the CVS plug-in is loaded. To avoid 
  this, open the CVS Repositories view (thus loading the CVS plug-in) before importing 
  CVS projects into Eclipse. </p>
<p><strong>3. The 'extssh' connection method</strong></p>
<p>The <em>extssh</em> connection method is unique to Eclipse CVS and doesn't 
  exist in the command-line CVS client. If you are using <em>extssh</em> to connect 
  to a SSH1 repository and would like to use the command line client for some 
  CVS operations you have to create a new location in Eclipse that uses a compatible 
  connection method:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new repository location that uses a CVS command line client compatible 
    connection method (e.g. <em>pserver</em> or <em>ext</em>). The repository 
    path, host, and user should be identical to those in the <em>extssh</em> location.</li>
  <li>Select the project that is shared with the <em>extssh</em> location and 
    open the CVS properties page. This is the project that you wanted to run external 
    CVS commands on.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Change Sharing...</strong> button and select the new 
    location that uses either the <em>ext</em> or <em>pserver</em>.</li>
  <li>Next, you can run command line CVS operations and then return to Eclipse. 
    <em>Don't forget to refresh</em>!</li>
</ol>
