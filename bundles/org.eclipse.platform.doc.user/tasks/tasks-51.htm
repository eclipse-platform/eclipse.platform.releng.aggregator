<H1>Associating editors with file types</H1>
<P>To associate editors with various file types in the Workbench:</P>
<ol>
  <li>From the main menu, select <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>.</li>
  <li>In the Preferences window, select the <b>General &gt; Editors &gt;
  File Associations</b> page .</li>
  <li>Select the file type from the <b>File types</b> list, or click <b>Add</b>
    to add a type that is not already on the list.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Associated editors</b> list, select the editor that you want 
    to associate with that file type. To add an editor to the list: 
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Click <b>Add</b>. The Editor Selection dialog box opens.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Internal Editors</b> or <b>External Programs</b>, depending on
          whether the editor that you want was built for the Workbench or runs outside the Workbench.</li>
      <li>If you select <b>External Programs</b>, you can click the Browse button to
          browse the file system.</li>
      <li>Select the editor from the list and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Click <b> OK</b> to finish associating the editor with the selected file type.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you associate an internal editor with a file type, that editor opens in
the editor area of the Workbench. For example,  if you double-click a file in the
Navigator or an entry in the Bookmarks or Tasks view it opens in the editor area.

selecting <b>Open With</b> from the pop-up menu for any resource in the
Navigator view.
