<H1>Using the Install wizard</H1>
<p>The <b>Install</b> wizard allows you to review and install new add-ons to your
software.  This wizard is shown when you select items and press <b>Install...</b> from the
<b>Available Software</b> page.  To install add-ons into your system:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the software items that you wish to install.  You may check and 
  uncheck different items in the list.  Each time you do, the compatibility of the
  selected items with your current system will be recomputed.</li>
  <li>If the selected items have license agreements to be reviewed, you must click <b>Next</b>.  
    Carefully review the license agreements for the items you wish to install.  You may also 
    notice items in the license list that you did not choose for install, but that are required
    by the the items that you are installing. If the 
    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms 
    in the license agreements.&quot; Do not proceed to download the features if 
    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>
  <li>If the license agreements are acceptable, or if the selected items did not have 
  license agreements to review, click <b>Finish</b>.  This will begin the download and
  installation of the new software.</li>  
  <li><p>Some of the items may be digitally signed by the company that provides them. 
    This allows you to verify more easily that the features and plug-ins 
    that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a trusted supplier. You
    may be prompted to verify digitally signed content once the signature is
    detected.</p><br>
    <p><b>Warning:</b> Because of the possibility of harmful or even malicious software, 
    you should only download software from parties that you trust.</li>
  <li>Once all of the software is downloaded successfully and the necessary
    files installed into the product on the local computer, you will be prompted
    to restart for the Workbench.  Click <b>Yes</b> 
    when asked to exit and restart the Workbench for the changes to take effect.</li>
