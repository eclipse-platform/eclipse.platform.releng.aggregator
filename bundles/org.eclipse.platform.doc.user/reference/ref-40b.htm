<h1 class="Head">CVS Sharing wizard</h1>
   
<p class="Para"> This wizard helps you share a project with others using a CVS 
  repository. It is available from the <strong>Team &gt; Share Project </strong>menu 
  command of views that display resources such as one of the navigation views 
  and the Java Packages Explorer.</p>
   
<p class="Para">The first page of the Sharing wizard allows you to choose the type of
repository you would like to share you project with. If the repository type
you wish to share with is not listed, you can click the Show All Wizards checkbox
to see repository types that are installed but not enabled.</p>

<p class="Para">
Selecting CVS will bring you to the CVS Sharing wizard. On the first page of the
CVS wizard, you can select the repository you wish to share with. If the repository
is not in the list, you can select to create a new repository.
If you choose to create a new location, the page from the 
<a href="ref-40.htm">New Repository Location wizard</a> is shown.
</p>

</p>

<p class="Para">
After you have selected the repository, you must indicate the name of the module
that will be used to share the project. You can choose to use the same name
as the local project or you can type in a path containing one or more folder segments
indicating the remote module. There is also an option to reconnect the local project to an existing
module.
</p>

</p>

<p class="Para"> The final page of the CVS Sharing wizard allows you to decide 
  which resources to commit and which to ignore. There are toolbar items for changing 
  the layout of the view and for committing and ignoring resources. If there are 
  resources left in the view when Finish is pressed, you will be prompted to commit 
  the remaining resources in the background (if the <em>Launch the Commit Wizard</em> 
  option is enabled) which will allow you to return to work while the commit takes 
  place. </p>
