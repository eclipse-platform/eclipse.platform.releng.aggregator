<h1>UI Responsiveness Monitoring</h1>

<p>Sometimes you may encounter a long pause when the GUI does not redraw or respond to typing or
mouse actions. Determining causes of such a UI freeze in most cases requires capturing stack traces
of Eclipse threads. In case you are experiencing UI freezes and want to report the problem to
the correct Eclipse project, you can enable <strong>UI Responsiveness Monitoring</strong>, which
will automatically detect UI freezes, capture stack traces, and write warning or error messages
containing the collected information to the Eclipse error log.</p>

<p>The <strong>UI Responsiveness Monitoring</strong> preference page allows you to enable automatic
detection of UI freezes and to modify parameters affecting freeze detection and logging.</p>

<p>UI freezes longer than the warning threshold value entered in the preference page are logged to
the Eclipse error log as warnings. The logged messages include one or more stack traces of
the UI thread. Longer UI freezes are logged as errors and include stack traces of all threads.
Please keep in mind that capturing stack traces of all threads involves extra
overhead, so setting the error threshold below 1 second is not recommended.</p>

<p>A UI freeze is logged at the end of the freeze or after the deadlock threshold has
expired, whichever comes first. The latter condition facilitates logging of indefinite
UI freezes caused by deadlocks. If Eclipse becomes completely unresponsive don't kill it until
the deadlock threshold expires. The message containing stack traces of all threads will be written
to the Eclipse error log.</p>

<p>It is possible to avoid logging of UI freezes matching a specific pattern. To achieve that, click
the <strong>Add Filter...</strong> button and type the fully qualified method name of a stack frame
to use as a filter. UI freezes containing this method in a stack trace of the UI thread will be
ignored.</p>

<p>Please file bugs for the UI freezes you encounter, describe what you were doing at the time and
include the messages and the stack traces from the error log related to the freezes. This way
the corresponding Eclipse project can work on the UI freeze and improve your user experience
with Eclipse.</p>
