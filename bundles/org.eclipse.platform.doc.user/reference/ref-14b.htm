Linked Resources</H1>
<P CLASS="Intro">

This preference page is used when working with 
<a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">linked resources</a>. The preference 
<b>Enable linked resources</b> is used to globally enable or disable the linked resource
feature for the entire workspace.  By default, linked resources are enabled. If you
disable linked resources, then you will not be able to create any new linked resources,
or import existing projects that contain linked resources.
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
Not all versions of the workbench support linked resources and recognize them as such. 
You may not want to use linked resources if you plan to share your workspace data with 
other users. Disable this preference if they will not be able to work with linked resources.

</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
The remainder of this page is for defining <a href="../concepts/cpathvars.htm">path variables</a> that are used when creating
linked resources.  Use the <b>New</b> button to define new variables, the <b>Edit</b>
button to change the value of an existing variable, and the <b>Remove</b> button to 
get rid of an existing variable.  Note if you change a path variable that
is currently in use, you will need to perform a local refresh on those projects to
&quot;discover&quot; what is different in the file system.  You can refresh a resource
by opening the Navigator context menu for that resource and selecting <b>Refresh</b>.
It is not recommended that you remove a path variable that is currently in use.
