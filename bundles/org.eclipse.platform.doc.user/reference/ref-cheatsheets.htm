<h2>Working with cheat sheets</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">Eclipse provides cheat sheets to guide you through some of its 
  application development processes. Each cheat sheet is designed to help you 
  complete some task, and it lists the sequence of steps required to help you 
  achieve that goal. As you progress from one step to the next, the cheat sheet 
  will automatically launch the required tools for you. If there is a manual step 
  in the process, the step will tell you to perform the task and click a button 
  in the cheat sheet to move on to the next step. Also, relevant help information 
  to guide you through a task is retrieved in a single click so that lengthy documentation 
  searches will no longer be required.</P>
<h3>Launching a cheat sheet</h3>
<p>There are two ways that cheat sheets can be accessed, on the Welcome page or 
  launched from the Workbench. </p>
<h4>Accessing a cheat sheet from the Welcome page</h4>
<ol>
 
  <li>When Eclipse is first started, the Welcome page is displayed, on this page 
    select <strong>Tutorials</strong>.<br>
	<img src="../images/image92-tutorial.gif" alt="Tutorial Icon" border="0" width="95" height="88"></li>
  <li> 
    <p>Then, from the Tutorials page select a cheat sheet. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Launching a cheat sheet from the Workbench</h4>
<ol>
  <li>To launch a cheat sheet from the Workbench, select <strong>Help &gt; Cheat 
    Sheets </strong>from the menu bar. </li>
  <br>
  <img src="../images/image92-opencheat.gif" alt="Accessing Cheat sheet via Help menu" border="0" width="155" height="157"></li> 
  <li>The available cheat sheets are listed, select one and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cheat sheet opens as a view. At any time, only one cheat sheet is open 
  and active. When you launch a cheat sheet, any opened cheat sheet is closed 
  before the new one is opened. The completion status of closed cheat sheet is 
  saved.</p>
<p>The cheat sheet has a toolbar at the top right edge. These icons appear in 
  the toolbar:</p>
<ul>
  <li><img src="../images/image92-collapse.gif" alt="Collapse button" border="0" width="21" height="21">Collapses 
    all the expanded steps except the current step or expands steps to the last 
    expanded state. Click to toggle between these two states. </li>
  <li><img src="../images/image92-select.gif" alt="Select button" border="0" width="24" height="22">Allows 
    you to select and open another cheat sheet. The completion status of the active 
    cheat sheet is saved. Then, the active cheat sheet is closed and the selected 
    cheat sheet is opened. </li>
  <li><img src="../images/image92-hide.gif" alt="Hide button" border="0" width="18" height="14">Hides 
    the cheat sheet. </li>
  <li><img src="../images/image92-save.gif" alt="Save button" border="0" width="15" height="16">Saves 
    the completion status of the active cheat sheet and closes it. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Starting the cheat sheet</h3>
<p> Each cheat sheet has a list of steps and it always begins with an Introduction 
  step. When you launch a fresh cheat sheet, the Introduction step is expanded 
  so that you can read a brief description of the cheat sheet. To start working 
  with the cheat sheet, click <strong> Click to Begin</strong> <strong><img src="../images/image92-begin.gif" alt="Click to Begin button" border="0" width="28" height="24"> 
  </strong>in that step. The next step is expanded and highlighted. You should 
  also see one or more actions buttons, such as <strong>Click to Perform </strong><strong><img src="../images/image92-perform.gif" alt="Click to Perform button" border="0" width="22" height="22"></strong> 
  in the highlighted step. You can now begin working through the tasks using the 
  cheat sheet. At any time, the only highlighted step in the cheat sheet is the 
  current step. </p>
<h3>Restarting the cheat sheet</h3>
<p>Any time after starting a cheat sheet, you can restart from the first step 
  by clicking <strong>Click to Restart </strong><strong><img src="../images/image92-restart.gif" alt="Click to Restart button" border="0" width="26" height="28"></strong> 
  in the Introduction step. If you have already created some artifacts, you will 
  have to manually clean up the workspace before restarting the cheat sheet.</p>
<h3>Progressing through the steps</h3>
<p>In the current step, when you click <strong>Click to Perform <img src="../images/image92-perform.gif" alt="Click to Perform button" border="0" width="22" height="22"></strong>, 
  a tool (which can be a wizard), will be launched and you will be required to 
  work with that tool. When you finish working with that tool, the next step is 
  automatically highlighted and it becomes the current step. When the current 
  step is a manual task, you will need to perform the work and click <strong>Click 
  to Complete </strong><strong><img src="../images/image92-complete.gif" alt="Click to Complete button" border="0" width="23" height="25"></strong> 
  to move to the next step. A check mark <strong><img src="../images/image92-check.gif" alt="Check mark icon" border="0" width="24" height="21"></strong> 
  appears in the left margin of each completed step.</p>
<h3>Getting help information for tasks</h3>
<p>To get step-by-step instructions for that step, click the help link <strong><img src="../images/image92-help.gif" alt="Help Link Icon" border="0" width="21" height="22"></strong> 
  in the step before you click <strong>Click to Perform</strong> <strong><img src="../images/image92-perform.gif" alt="Click to Perform button" border="0" width="24" height="16"></strong>, 
  and the step-by-step instructions on how to work with that tool will be displayed 
  in the Help window. </p>
<p>Additional help for entry fields in the tool or wizard may be available by 
  focusing on the field (use the <strong>Tab</strong> key to position to that 
  entry) and pressing <strong>F1</strong>.</p>
<h3>Skipping a step</h3>
<p>If a current step has a <strong>Click to Skip</strong> option<strong> <img src="../images/image92-skip.gif" alt="Click to Skip button" border="0" width="26" height="22"></strong>, 
  then it is an optional step. You must click <strong>Click to Skip</strong> <strong><img src="../images/image92-skip.gif" alt="Click to Skip button" border="0" width="26" height="22"></strong> 
  to skip the current step, when you do, the step will have the skip mark <strong><img src="../images/image92-skip-mark.gif" alt="Skip mark icon" border="0" width="23" height="20"></strong> 
  in the left margin. If the task does not present <strong>Click to Skip</strong>, 
  you must perform that step and you cannot skip it.</p>
<h3>Redoing a step </h3>
<p>You can redo any step that you may have completed or skipped in the current 
  cheat sheet. To redo the step, expand the step by clicking its expand <strong><img src="../images/image92-expand.gif" alt="Expand Icon" border="0" width="19" height="19"></strong>icon 
  and then clicking <strong>Click to Redo</strong> <strong><img src="../images/image92-redo.gif" alt="Click to Redo button" border="0" width="26" height="22"></strong>. 
  After redoing a step, the cheat sheet will continue from the redo step.</p>
<h3>Closing the cheat sheet</h3>
<p>When you finish the last step in a cheat sheet, it automatically restarts. 
  You can also close the active cheat sheet by clicking the close icon <strong><img src="../images/image92-close.gif" alt="Close icon" border="0" width="16" height="15"></strong> 
  in the cheat sheet's toolbar. The active cheat sheet saves its completion status 
  when it is closed so that you can continue where you left off at a later time.<br>
