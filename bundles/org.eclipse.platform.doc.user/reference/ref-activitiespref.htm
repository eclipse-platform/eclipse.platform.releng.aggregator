<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">The Capabilities preference page allows you to enable or disable 
  various product components such as Java development and plug-in development. By 
  default, the page only shows general categories of behaviour.  If you would like
  configure fine-grained capabilities you should use the "Advanced" dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"><strong>Note:</strong> Some capability selections have dependencies 
  on other capabilities, disabling a required capability while leaving dependant 
  capabilities enabled will only result in them becoming re-enabled. This is the 
  case when deselecting Java Development and Core Team Support.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">Here is what the Capabilities preference page looks like: </P>

<p>When attempting to enable an action after its capability has been disabled 
  or has yet to be enabled in the preferences page, the following <strong>Confirm 
  Enablement </strong>prompt will appear verifying that you do indeed want to 
  enable the required capability. Click <strong>Details</strong> to display a 
  description of the capability.</p>

  "Prompt when enabling capabilities" preference has not been disabled.</P>
