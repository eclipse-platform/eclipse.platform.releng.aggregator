<h1 class="Head"> Compare editor</h1>
       
<p class="Para"> You can view the differences between two files by comparing 
 them.    You can compare different files, you can compare versions in 
 the Workbench    with versions in the repository, or with the local edit history.&nbsp;
 In some    cases you can compare three files (when a common ancestor exists).
 </p>
       
<p class="Para"> After a comparison is carried out, the compare editor opens 
 in    the editor area. In the compare editor, you can&nbsp; browse through 
 all the    differences and copy highlighted differences between the compared 
 resources.    You can save changes to resources that are made in the comparison 
 editor. </p>
       
<p class="Para">Here is how the compare editor looks when you open it from a CVS 
Workspace synchronization..</p>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
       
<p>The toolbar of the Compare editor includes the following buttons:</p>
           
<dl>
  <dt>Control Visibility of Ancestor Pane</dt>
  <dd>There are two conditions under which a three way compare will occur, 
          both when using the Team version management support: when comparing 
 a          file that is in conflict, and when comparing a file being merged 
 from          a branch. In both cases, the system will determine a common 
 ancestor in          the repository to compare the conflict or merge against. 
 This button determines          the visibility of the third editor. By default, 
 the ancestor pane is not          visible.</dd>
  <dt>Perform Three way/Two way Compare</dt>
  <dd>The compare editor can be toggled between performing a three way compare 
          or a two way compare which ignores the common ancestor.</dd>
  <dt>Copy All from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Copies the entire contents of the file in the left pane into the file 
          in the right pane, making the contents of the two files identical.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Copy All Non-Conflicting Changes from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Copies all the non-conflicting changes from the right pane into the left
  pane. Conflicting changes must be copied individually.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Merges changes in two files by copying the highlighted change in the 
          left pane into the highlighted fragment on the right.&nbsp; This 
 will          overwrite the highlighted fragment in the right pane.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
  <dt>Select Next Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the next difference that is found between the compared resources.</dd>
  <dt>Select Previous Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the previous difference that is found between the compared 
          resources.</dd>
