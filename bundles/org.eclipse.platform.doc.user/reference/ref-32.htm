<h1> CVS Repositories view</h1>
     
<p class="Para">The CVS Repositories view, which is part of the CVS Repository
    Exploring perspective, shows the CVS repository locations that you have
 added    to your Workbench.&nbsp;Expanding a location reveals the main trunk
 (HEAD),    project versions and branches in that repository. You can further
 expand the    project versions and branches to reveal the folders and files
 contained within    them. </p>
     
<p>The pop-up menu for this view also allows you to specify new repository
 locations.    Use the CVS Repositories view to check out resources from
 the repository    to the Workbench, configure the branches and versions
shown  by the view, view    resource history, and compare resource versions.
</p>
     
<p class="Para"> Here is what the CVS Repositories view looks like:</p>
     
<p class="Para"> <img

</p>
     
     
  <p>Like other views in the Workbench, the CVS Repositories view has its own 
    toolbar. Toolbar buttons are provided for refreshing the view, navigating
    and creating new repository locations. 
    The toolbar also contains a drop-down menu that allows the user to filter 
    the view by working set.</p>
       
<h2>Toolbar</h2>

<div class="Topic">     
<h3>Collapse All</h3>
  <p class="Para"> This command collapses all expanded entries in the Repositories 
    view.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic">     
<h3>Add CVS Repository</h3>
  <p class="Para"> This command brings up the wizard to help you specify a new repository 
  location.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="Para">Drop-Down Menu</h3>
<p class="Para">The drop down menu in the title bar allows the repositories view 
  to be filtered by a working set.</p>
     
<h2 class="Para">Context menu </h2>
     
<p class="Para">From the context menu of the Repositories view you can  perform
a number    of interesting operations.</p>
     
<h3>  New &gt; Repository Location&nbsp;</h3>
     
<p class="Para">This command brings up the wizard to help you specify a new repository 
  location (same as Add CVS Repository toolbar item).</p>
  
  <h3>  New &gt; Date Tag</h3>
     
<p class="Para">This command, available on the repository location and Date category 
  entries, brings up the dialog which allows the specification of a date tag that 
  is to be added to the Date category of the location entry in the Repositories 
  view.</p>

<h3>Check Out</h3>
<p>This command checks the selected CVS modules out into projects in the Workbench 
  with the same names as the remote modules (for remote modules that are folders 
  on the server) or into projects with the name specified with the module (if 
  the module is defined in the CVSROOT/modules file on the server).</p>
     
<h3>Check Out As...</h3>
<p>This command open the Check Out wizard in order to allow the configuration of how the selected remote modules
are checked out into the Workbench.</p>

<h3>Tag as Version...</h3>  
<p> This command versions the selected resource based on the current branch
 contents.</p>
     
<h3>Tag with Existing...</h3>  
<p> This command versions the selected resource based on the current branch
 contents,    moving the tag from previously tagged resources if required.</p>

<h3> Compare</h3>   
<p class="Para">This command will compare two selected resources.</p>

<h3>Compare With...</h3>
<p class="Para">This command will compare the selected folder with a branch or 
version of the same folder.</p>
  
<h3>Configure Branches and Versions</h3>
<p class="Para"> This command brings up the wizard to help you discover the branch 
  and version tags that exist in the repository for the selected folder so they 
  can be added to the repositories view to allow the resources that have these 
  tags can be browsed.</p>

<h3>Refresh Branches and Versions</h3>
<p class="Para"> This command, available on repository location entries, allows 
  you to refresh the list of known branches and versions that are displayed in 
  the repositories view for selected projects. This operation makes use of the 
  defined auto-refresh files for each project. If the operation fails for a particular 
  project, use Configure Branches and Versions on the project to select one or 
  more appropriate refresh files.</p>
  
<h3>Add to Branch List...</h3>
<p> This command adds the selected project to the list of projects that are displayed 
  under the specified branch in the repositories view. This command only modifies 
  the repositories view and does not effect the repository in any way. If you 
  want to add the project to a branch, you can perform a <strong>Tag with Existing</strong> 
  after performing this operation.</p>
  
<h3> Open</h3>
<p> This command opens the selected file in an editor.&nbsp; Since file revisions
    in the repository are immutable, the editor opens in a read-only state,
 so it    is not modifiable.&nbsp; </p>

<h3> Show Annotation</h3>   
<p> This command shows the contents of file with annotations identifying the author
of each line of code in the file.</p>
   
<h3> Show in Resource History</h3>   
<p> This command shows the revision history of the selected file in the CVS
 Resource    History view.</p>
     

<h3>Properties</h3>   
<p> Available on repository location entries, this command allows the modification 
  of any of the properties of the location. It also allows the assignment of a 
  display name and a server encoding which is used to translate file paths and 
  commit comments between the client and server (but does not affect file contents).</p>
