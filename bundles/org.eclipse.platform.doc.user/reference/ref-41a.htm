Merge wizard</H1>
<P CLASS="Intro"> This wizard helps you merge changes between two states of a 
  project into your workspace. Often the Merge Wizard is used to move changes 
  from one branch into another, for example after splitting a branch to work on 
  a bug fix. The merge operation takes changes between two points in a branch, 
  the <b> start point</b> and the <b> end point</b>, and merges them into your 
  workspace. Typically the start point will be the root of a branch (version tag) 
  and the end point can either be the tip (latest and best) of the branch 
  or another version tag.<br>
  <br>
  It is very important to understand that the destination of the merge is always 
  the project in your workspace. After the merge has been completed you can test the 
  changes locally and then commit them to the new branch (usually HEAD).</p>
<P CLASS="Intro">To start a merge, select a project (or one or more resources), 
  and select <b>Team &gt; Merge...</b> from the pop-up menu. The following dialog 
  will appear.</p>

</P>


<p>First, you should choose the end tag of the merge. This is the branch or version 
  being merged into the workspace. Choose a version when you want to merge the 
  differences between two versions of a project into your workspace. Choose a 
  branch if you want to merge the changes made in the branch into your local workspace.</p>
<p>The wizard will try to pick an appropriate tag for the start tag or base tag. 
  If one cannot be determined, you should enter it manually. If there is no start 
  tag, you can choose to merge without a preview, in which case a start tag is 
  not required but the merge will happen directly into the workspace. The drawback 
  of this is that CVS uses a text base markup to identify conflicts and this is 
  cumbersome to work with.</p>


<P>If the merge preview option is selected, after the finish button is pressed, 
  the changes between the start point and end point are calculated and displayed 
  as a <a href="ref-33a.htm">CVS Merge Synchronization</a> in the Synchronize 
  view. Depending on the size of the project you are merging, this may take some 
  time but can be run in the background. In the Synchronize view you can update 
  or merge changes into your Workbench. Also, you have the option to automatically 
  merge non-conflicting changes which means you will only need to deal with the conflicting changes in
  the Synchronize view.</P>
