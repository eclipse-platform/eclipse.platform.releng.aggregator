<H1 class="Head">Secure Storage</H1>

<p>The secure storage saves data in an encrypted form. On some operating systems &mdash; Windows and Macintosh at the time 
of this writing &mdash; it uses your operating system account information to provide a single sign-on experience.</p> 

<p>The secure storage itself does not contain encryption code. It uses algorithms supplied by the Java virtual machine 
and/or the operating system.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>What encryption is used?</h4>
<p>By default, the 56-bit DES algorithm is requested from the Java virtual machine.</p> 
<p>The Secure Storage preferences allows you to change the encryption algorithm. Note that the new algorithm 
will be applied to newly created secure storages only. The list of compatible algorithms depends on the Java 
virtual machine running this application.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>How do I change a password?</h4>
<p>You can change password via &quot;Change Password...&quot; button on the Secure Storage preference page.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Secure Storage preferences page can be found under
   <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui.storage)")'>

<h2>Resolving Problems</h2>

<ul>
<li><h4>Lost secure storage password or invalid secure storage password</h4>

<p>If you have specified password recovery questions/answers, you can use the Secure Storage preferences page to 
recover the master password. After the master password has been recovered, it is strongly 
recommended that you change the master password using the &quot;Change Password...&quot; button on 
the Secure Storage preference page.</p>
<p>The recovered password is not displayed, but stored in the memory cache until the application is closed.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>If all else fails</h4>
<p>If you have a problem with secure storage that you can not find a workaround for, the secure storage can be deleted 
using &quot;Delete&quot; button on the Secure Storage preference page. This, of course, will delete all the contents 
of the secure storage. It is highly recommended that you restart the application after secure storage has been deleted.</p>
