Ignored Resources</H1>
<P CLASS="Intro"> On the <strong>Team&gt;Ignored Resources</strong> preference 
  page, you can specify file name patterns to exclude from the version control 
  management system. There is a list of file patterns against which resources 
  will be matched before they are considered as version control candidates.&nbsp; 
  These patterns may contain the wildcard characters "*" and "?".&nbsp; This pattern 
  "*" represents any sequence of zero or more characters.&nbsp; This pattern "?" 
  represents any one character.&nbsp; For example, you can specify a pattern of 
  "*~", which would match any temporary files that end with "~".&nbsp;&nbsp; Any 
  file or directory that matches any one of the patterns will be ignored during&nbsp; 
  update or commit operations.&nbsp; 
<P CLASS="Para"> To add a file type to the ignore list, simply click on the <strong>Add</strong> 
  button. In the dialog, enter a file type (e.g. *.class). To remove a file type 
  from the ignore list, simply select the file type in the ignore list and click 
  on the <strong>Remove</strong> button.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> You can temporarily disable ignoring the file pattern by de-selecting 
  it from the list. You do not have to remove the specified file pattern from 
  the list to temporarily disable it.</P>
