The Workbench periodically saves a snapshot in order to reduce the risk of
losing data due to crashes.
<UL CLASS="UnorderedList">
<LI CLASS="Item">
Saved data is never lost as it is written to disk immediately (upon save). </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Unsaved data in open editors may be lost, depending on the editor implementation.  </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Bookmarks and tasks might be lost.  </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
If a crash occurs during CVS synchronization, the Workbench may be out of sync.
You can check by performing the synchronize operation again. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Previously-created projects are never lost.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Developers of plug-ins can also choose to participate in this lifecycle and save
the state of their plug-ins.</p>
