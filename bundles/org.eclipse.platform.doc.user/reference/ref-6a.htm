Local history</H1>
<p>Local history of a file is maintained when you create or modify a file. Each time you edit and save
a file,&nbsp;a copy of it is saved. This allows you to compare
your current file state to a previous state, or replace the file with a previous
state.&nbsp;Each state in the local
history is identified by the date and time the file was
saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither projects nor folders have local history.</p>
<p>Local History is displayed in the History View. Here is a look at what the local history of a Workbench file might look
like: </p>
<p><img src="../images/Image273_local_hist.png" alt="Local history dialog" border="0" ></p>
<P>To view the local history of a file, choose <b>Team &gt; Show Local History</b> from the pop-up
menu.&nbsp; This will bring up the History view and populate it with the revisions of the selected
file. You can open different revisions from the table (by using <b>Open</b> from the context menu or 
by double clicking on a revision), compare them against the latest revision or against a
previous revisions (by using <b>Compare With Revision</b> from the context menu), and replace the current revision 
with the contents of a previous revisions (by using <b>Get Contents</b> from the context menu). 
</P>

<p><i>Note</i>: Projects that are managed by CVS now have the local history revisions displayed
alongside remote revisions. In order to see the local history for a CVS managed file, select the
<b>Team &gt; Show History</b> menu item and make sure that the History View is one of the modes capable
of showing local history. </p>
