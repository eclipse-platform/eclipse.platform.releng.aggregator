<h1>CVS Merge Synchronization</h1>
<p class="Para">CVS Merge synchronizations launched using the <b>Team &gt; Merge</b> 
  menu command will appear in the Synchronize view. This view allows you to inspect 
  the differences between the local Workbench resources and their remote counterparts 
  that are being merged and allows you to update the local resources. Committing 
  is not supported when merging.</p>
   
<p class="Para"> Here is what the CVS Merge Synchronization in the Synchronize view looks like:</p>
   
<p class="Para"> <img src="../images/cvs-merge-sync.png"  align="top" border="0" alt="CVS Merge Synchronization">

 </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p class="Para"> 
The features of the CVS Merge Synchronization are similar to those of the 
<a href="ref-33.htm">CVS Workspace Synchronization</a> with the following
differences.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Modes:</b>
When merging, only incoming and conflicting changes are possible. 
As such, only the Incoming Mode and Conflicts mode are supported.</li>

  <li><b>Operations:</b> Only updating is supported when merging.</li>
  <li><b>Ongoing merges:</b> In order to compensate for the poor ongoing merge 
support of CVS, a CVS Merge Synchronization can be pinned and kept indefinitely.
The timestamps of merged changes are recorded and, on refresh, only new changes since the last
merge are shown in the view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>

<p>The Toolbar buttons are the exact same as in the <a href="ref-33.htm">CVS Workspace Synchronization</a>,
with the omission of an Outgoing mode and Both mode buttons.</p> 

<h2 class="Para">Context menu </h2>
     
<p class="Para">From the context menu of the Synchronize view you can  perform
a number of interesting operations.</p>
        
<h3>Open</h3>
<p class="Para">This command open the local resource for the selected change in 
the default Workbench editor for the file type.</p>

<h3>Open With</h3>
<p class="Para">This command allows you to open the local resource for the selected 
  change in the a Workbench editor.</p>

<h3>Open in Compare Editor</h3>
<p class="Para">This command open the selected change in a Compare editor which allows 
you to inspect the changes within the file.</p>

<h3>Synchronize</h3>
<p class="Para">This command refreshed the remote state of the selected resources.
  In addition, this command will adjust the timestamps of outgoing changes whose 
  contents already match the contents of the corresponding resource on the server 
  so that the file is no longer an outgoing change. This is useful in situations 
  where build tools regenerate files whose contents have not changed.</p>

<h3>Remove From View</h3>
<p class="Para">This command removes the selected resources from the view. The
resources will only reappear if the state of the removed resources changes or the 
Workbench is restarted.</p>

<h3>Expand All</h3>
<p class="Para">This command expands all of the selected resource's children.</p>

<h3>Merge</h3>
<p class="Para">This command updates the selected resources. Conflicts can be 
  included in an update but only auto-mergeable conflicts will be updated. Non-mergeable 
  conflicts will be skipped and should be merged manually using a compare editor.</p>

<h3>Overwrite</h3>
<p class="Para">This command operates on conflicts
and replaces the local contents of those resources with the contents 
from the server.</p>

<h3>Mark as Merged</h3>
<p class="Para">This command adjusts the CVS timestamps of conflicting changes
so they become outgoing changes. This command should be performed after
conflicts are merged manually using a compare editor.</p>

<h3>Show Annotation</h3>
<p class="Para">Depending on your Annotation preferences, this command will either bring up turn on the Quick Diff annotate
or open the Annotate view for the selected resource.</p>

<h3>Show in History</h3>
<p class="Para">This command will show the history for the selected resource..</p>
