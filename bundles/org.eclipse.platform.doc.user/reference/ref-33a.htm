<h1>CVS Merge Synchronization</h1>


<p class="Para">CVS Merge synchronizations launched using the <b>Team &gt; Merge</b>
menu command will appear
in the Synchronize view. This view allows you to inspect the differences between the local 
Workbench resources and their remote counterparts that are being merged and allows you to 
update the local resources. Comitting is not supported when merging.</p>
   
<p class="Para"> Here is what the CVS Merge Synchronization in the Synchronize view looks like:</p>

 </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p class="Para"> 
The features of the CVS Merge Synchronization are similar to those of the 
<a href="ref-33.htm">CVS Workspace Synchronization</a> with the following
differences.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Modes:</b>
When merging, only incoming and conflicting changes are possible. 
As such, only the Incoming Mode and Conflicts mode are supported.

<li><b>Operations:</b> Only updating is suppoted when merging.

<li><b>Ongoing merges:</b> In order to compensate for the poor ongoing merge 
support of CVS, a CVS Merge Synchronization can be pinned and kept indefinitely.
The timestamps of merged changes are recorded and, on refresh, only new changes since the last
merge are shown in the view.
</ul>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Synchronize</h3>  
<p class="Para">This command allows you to repeat the current synchronization which refetches the 
remote state of the resources. The drop down of
the toolbar item allows you to select other existing synchronizations or create new ones using
the <b>Synchronize...</b> menu command.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Pin Current Synchronization</h3>  
<p class="Para">This command allows you to pin or unpin the current synchronization.
Pinned synchronizations will not be replaced by the next synchronization of the same type
while unpinned synchronizations will be replaced.
This allows you to keep a synchronization around for easy access. Such a synchronization 
will automatically update when changes to Workbench resources take place and can be configured
to perform scheduled refreshes in order to keep up-to-date with the remote state of the resources.
This is expecially handy for ongoing merges from a more stable banch (e.g. HEAD)
into a development branch.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Go to Next Difference</h3>  
<p class="Para">This command will go to the next difference displayed by the view. All the
differences within a single file will be visited before opening the next file in the view.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Go to Previous Difference</h3>  
<p class="Para">This command will go to the previous difference displayed by the view. All the
differences within a single file will be visited before opening the previous file in the view.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Collapse All</h3>  
<p class="Para">Collapse all the expanded entries in the view.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Incoming Mode</h3>  
<p class="Para">In this mode, all resources which have been changed in the branch
being merged are visible.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Conflicts Mode</h3>  
<p class="Para"> In this mode only conflicts (resources modified both in the Workbench 
and in the branch being merged) are shown.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Update All Incoming Changes</h3>  
<p class="Para">This command updates all the incoming changes visible in the view.
The command will also update conflicts that are auto-mergable but will skip files
whose contents contain conflicts.</p>
</div>

<div class="Topic"> 
<h3>Drop Down Menu</h3>  
<p class="Para">The drop down menu allows you to remove the current or all synchronizations,
change the mode or layout, configure the current synchronization to perform scheduled refreshes
as well as set other veiw preferences.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="Para">Context menu </h2>
     
<p class="Para">From the context menu of the Synchronize view you can  perform
a number of interesting operations.</p>
     
<h3>Open in Compare Editor</h3>
<p class="Para">This command open the selected change in a Compare editor which allows 
you to inspect the changes within the file.</p>

<h3>Open</h3>
<p class="Para">This command open the local resource for the selected change in 
the default Workbench editor for the file type.</p>

<h3>Open With</h3>
<p class="Para">This command allows youu to open the local resource for the selected change in 
the a Workbench editor.</p>

<h3>Synchronize</h3>
<p class="Para">This command refreshed the remote state of the selected resources.</p>

<h3>Remove From View</h3>
<p class="Para">This command removes the selected resources from the view. The
resources will only reappear if the state of the removed resources changes or the 
Workbench is restarted.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p class="Para">This command updates the selected resources. Conflicts 
can be included in an update but only auto-mergable conflicts will be updated.
Non-mergable conflicts will be skipped and should be merged manually using
a compare editor.</p>

<h3>Override and Update</h3>
<p class="Para">This command operates on conflicts and outgoing changes
and replaces the local contents of those resources with the contents 
from the server.</p>

<h3>Mark as Merged</h3>
<p class="Para">This command removes the change from the view. This command should be performed after
conflicts are merged manually using a compare editor. The change will only reappear
if the view is refreshed and new changes are found in the branch being merged.</p>
