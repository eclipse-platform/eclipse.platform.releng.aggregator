<h1>
Web-triggered updates</h1><p>Eclipse update manager can be used to render and browse Eclipse update sites
in a predictable manner. An update site can contain categories shown in the tree
view, and these categories in turn contain features. Features can be inspect in
the Preview view inside update manager. If a feature is a valid install
candidate, it will contain a button &quot;Install Now&quot; that will launch
Eclipse install wizard. Upon completion of the install task, the feature will be
part of the product.</p>
<p>This standard way of presenting features for installation is not the only
way. Providers can take over presentation, registration, search and other tasks
from update manager and return control only when it is time to actually install
a feature into an Eclipse product.</p>
<p>Update manager is capable of running a servlet that can accept requests from
Web pages. This capability is not automatic: it must be activated in <b>Preferences&gt;Install/Update&gt;Web-triggered
Updates</b> page. When <b>OK</b> is pressed, update manager will activate the
application server that can handle incoming requests. After that, all URLs
opened from within Update Manager will be encoded with the callback URL
information. If the initial URL is a regular Web page, the encoded URL will have
the query part that adds the callback URL to use to call Eclipse:</p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <pre align="left">http://acme.com/myApplication.html</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">becomes</p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <pre align="left">http://acme.com/myApplication.html?updateURL=&lt;localhost&gt;:&lt;localport&gt;?org.eclipse.update/install</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">where 'localhost' is the address of the Eclipse server running
on your local machine, local port is selected dynamically when the server is
started, and the query is the Eclipse Web application name and the name of the
servlet that handles the request.</p>
<p align="left">If the original URL is already a query:</p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <pre align="left">http://acme.com/myApplication/myServlet?arg1=value1&amp;arg2=value2</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">the encoding will simply add our information as another
parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <pre align="left">http://acme.com/myApplication/myServlet?arg1=value1&amp;arg2=value2&amp;updateURL=&lt;localhost&gt;:&lt;localport&gt;?org.eclipse.update/install</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The encoding is ignored by normal web pages and queries and does
not cause any problems nor it affects the presentation. It simply adds
information that can be used by a page that knows about it.</p>
<p align="left">Since a Web page must be launched from update manager, site
bookmarks in Updates view can be created as Web bookmarks. Update manager treats
these bookmarks accordingly and when you double-click on one, it will open the
URL in a browser (if embedded browser is available on the version of operating
and windowing system, it will open directly inside update manager; otherwise, it
will open in the resident browser window).</p>
<h3 align="left">Tasks that can be performed in a Web page</h3>
<p align="left">Providers can set up their Update web pages any way they want:
they can use elaborate Web applications backed by databases, or use simple,
static HTML. Using more complex architecture allows providers to offer more
value to users. Complex searches for new features, updates and e-fixes, rich
visual presentations of selected features, articles on their functionality,
various useful links, 'most popular features' votes are just some of the
possibilities. In addition, providers can enable authentication to restrict
access to some of the features, require user registration etc.</p>
<h3 align="left">Calling Eclipse from a Web page</h3>
<p align="left">There are many different ways to extract the encoded
information. A very simple one is to use Java Script function as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre align="left">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;

function getArgs() {
   var args = new Object();
   var query = location.search.substring(1);
   var pairs = query.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;);
   for (var i=0; i&lt;pairs.length; i++) {
      var pos = pairs[i].indexOf('=');
      if (pos == -1) continue;
      var argname = pairs[i].substring(0, pos);
      var value = pairs[i].substring(pos+1);
      args[argname] = unescape(value);
   }
   return args;
}
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The function above parses the URL of the current page and
returns query arguments as an array.</p>
<p align="left">The role of the callback URL is to allow Web pages to return
control back to Eclipse. Once user selected a feature to install, it must return
back to Eclipse to complete it. The role of Web-triggered update is not to make
update sites obsolete: they are still needed, but in this scenario they are used
simply as a location where features are physically stored. Web page must at some
point call back into Eclipse and pass the update site URL, as well as the
selected feature ID and version. This information is encoded by using the
original callback URL and adding the arguments, thus forming a query.</p>
<p>The arguments for the callback query are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>server</b> - expects a URL of the Eclipse Update site (the one with
    site.xml) where feature and plug-in archives are placed. This URL can be the
    same as the web site, or can be a completely different server (you probably
    had experience with download sites in which the actual data servers are
    different from the front end and use different protocols, e.g. FTP).
  <li><b>feature</b> - expects a string in the form &lt;id&gt;_&lt;version&gt;
    where 'id' is the feature identifier and 'version' is its version. These
    values will be used to locate the feature on the update server.
  <li><b>backURL</b> - passes the URL of the page itself that will be used in
    Eclipse servlet to feed the 'Go Back' links (those that will get you back to
    this page)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Calling back to Eclipse should be done when users finished all
their selections in the Web page and all that is left is to press some kind of
'Download' button or hyperlink. A simple implementation of this capability would
be:</p>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    <pre align="left">&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; 	name=&quot;Download&quot; value=&quot;Download&quot; 
			onClick=&quot;javascript:download('com.example.root', '1.0.0')&quot;&gt;</pre>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the code above, feature Id and versions are hard-coded in the button tag.</p>
<p>The download function can be implemented as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>function download(id, version) {
   var args = getArgs();
   if (args.updateURL) {
      var updateURL = args.updateURL;
      var callback = updateURL+&quot;?server=
      &quot;+escape(&quot;<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-update-home/optionalSite/index.html">http://acme.com/updateSite</a>/&quot;)+
      &quot;&amp;feature=&quot;+escape(id+'_'+version)+&quot;&amp;backURL=&quot;+escape(location);
      location = callback;
   }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the JavaScript function above, the callback URL that was encoded in the
page URL from the beginning is used to form the query. Once the query is
created, the browser is asked to open it. This step will cause the browser to
call Eclipse servlet, which will process the query, connect to the provider
update site (in this case &quot;http://acme.com/updateSite/&quot;) and locate
the feature with the provided id and version. If everything goes well, Eclipse
window will be brought to the top and the familiar install wizard will open. At
that point, you will be back in Eclipse and can finish the installation as
usual.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that having encoded callback URL is crucial for
the whole mechanism. If the page that contains the 'download' link or button is
several levels deep in the web site map, the root web page (the one launched
from update manager) has to ensure the callback URL passed down to all pages
opened from within that page. It can be done in various ways (direct encoding in
the page, saving a transient cookie, storing it in a servlet that serves the
pages from the site etc.).</p>
