<title>Installing software using p2 director application</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Installing software using p2 director application</h1>
In addition to the "Software Updates" dialog it is possible to perform
provisioning operations by running eclipse in a command line mode. We
usually refer to it as the director application. The director
application is a headless way of performing some of the p2 operations
such as installing or uninstalling installable units. Given the
appropriate metadata, this application is capable on provisioning a
complete installation from scratch or simply extending your application.
Depending on the needs, this application can be executed inside or
outside of the application being provisioned

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Director application:</b> the application performing p2
	operations such as install or uninstall. This application is provided
	by the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app bundle.</li>
	<li><b>Provisioning operation:</b> an operation installing,
	uninstalling features.
	<li><b>Target product:</b> the installation targeted by the
	provisioning operation.</li>
	<li><b>Builder:</b> an eclipse based application containing the
	director application bundle and its depents.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Running inside the target application</h2>
<p>In this mode, the provisioning operation happens from within the
targeted product that you are provisioning. It is equivalent to starting
up the targeted product and using the p2 UI to perform the equivalent
operation.</p>
<p>This means that the target application has to be in a runnable
state and has to contain the director application bundle. Also since the
target product will have run, cache files will have been created in the
configuration folder (e.g. configuration/org.eclipse.osgi).</p>
<p>The following example shows the command line used to install CDT
into the SDK.</p>
<pre>
<code>
  &lt;targetProductFolder&gt;/eclipse.exe 
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app.application 
   -metadataRepository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/ganymede/
   -artifactRepository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/ganymede/
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group
   -version &lt;version&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Provisioning without running the target application</h2>
<p>In this case the provisioning operation is happening "outside" of
the targeted product. The "targeted product" is *not* started. This
allows to both modify an existing installation and create a complete
installation from scratch given proper metadata.</p>

<p>It also has the advantage that since the targeted product does
not need to be started, the provisioning operation can be performed on
any platform for any other platform (e.g. on my linux machine, one can
add plug-ins to a windows-based target application).</p>

<h3>Installing / uninstalling IUs into a target product</h3>
<p>To install or uninstall something into an existing target product
a few extra arguments than in the "inside" mode need to be set. It
mostly consist in letting the provisioning operation the ID of the
profile it needs to operate on, and where it is located on disk.</p>

<p>For example, if from a directory called "d:\builder" containing
the builder, you want to install CDT into an existing SDK located into
"d:\eclipse", you would use the following command line. It is important
to note the presence of the VM args and set it properly.</p>
<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipse.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app.application
   -metadataRepository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/ganymede/
   -artifactRepository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/ganymede/l
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group
   -version &lt;version&gt;
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile
   
   -vmArgs
   -Declipse.p2.data.area=d:/eclipse/p2
   </code>
</pre>
<p>Note that there is no need to describe the os/ws/arch of the
platform being targeted because all this information is already being
available in the profile of the application in which we are
provisioning.</p>

<h3>Installing a complete product</h3>
<p>The creation of a complete product using the director application
only needs a few extra arguments to the previous example. Most of these
consist in values used to initialize the profile in which the
application will be provisioned.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrate how to create a linux/gtk
installation of the Eclipse SDK into a folder called "d:\eclipse" using
a director application located in "d:\builder".</p>

<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipse.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app.application
   -metadataRepository http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.4 
   -artifactRepository http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.4
   -installIU org.eclipse.sdk.ide
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile
   -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true
   -bundlepool d:/eclipse/
   -p2.os linux
   -p2.ws gtk
   -p2.arch x86
   -roaming
   
   -vmargs
   -Declipse.p2.data.area=d:/eclipse/p2
</code>
</pre>
<p>The -p2.* arguments describe the os/ws/arch that the provisioned
product is targeting. Here again notice the presence of the -vmargs
pointing at the eclipse data area for the installation being created.</p>

<h2>Arguments Description</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>-application
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app.application</b>: the application ID.</li>
<li><b>-metadataRepository</b>: a comma separated list of
metadata repositories where the installable units to be installed can be
found.</li>
<li><b>-artifactRepository</b>: a comma separated list of
artifact repositories where the artifacts can be found.</li>
<li><b>-installIU</b>: the identifier of the installable unit
to install. If you are looking to install a feature, the identifier of
the feature has to be suffixed with ".feature.group".</li>
<li><b>-version</b>: the version of the IU to be installed. </li>
<li><b>-destination</b>: the folder in which the targeted
product is located.</li>
<li><b>-profile</b>: the profile id containing the
description of the targeted product. This ID is usually found
eclipse.p2.profile property contained in the config.ini of the targeted
product. For the Eclipse SDK the ID is "SDKProfile"</li>
<li><b>-profileProperties</b>: a comma separated list of &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
pair. The property org.eclipse.update.install.features=true will cause
the update manager features to be installed.</li>
<li><b>eclipse.p2.data.area</b> this property points at location of the profile
registry containing the description of the profile set in "-profile:". It is recommended to set it to be
&lt;destination&gt;/p2. This property *must* be set as a VM argument.
<li><b>-bundlepool</b>: the location of where the plug-ins and features will be stoed. This value is
only taken into account when a new profile is created. For an
application where all the bundles are located into the plugins/ folder
of the destination, set it to &lt;destination&gt;.</li>
<li><b>-p2.os</b>: the OS to use when the profile is created.
This will be used to filter which OS specific installable units need to
be installed.</li>
<li><b>-p2.ws</b>: the windowing system to use when the
profile is created. This will be used to filter which WS specific
installable units need to be installed.</li>
<li><b>-p2.arch</b>: the architecture to use when the profile
is created. This will be used to filter which architecture specific
installable units need to be installed.</li>
<li><b>-roaming</b>: indicates that the product resulting
from the installation can be moved. This property only makes sense when
the destination, bundle pool are in the same location and
eclipse.p2.data.area is set to destination/p2. This value is only taken
into account when the profile is created.</li>
</ul>
