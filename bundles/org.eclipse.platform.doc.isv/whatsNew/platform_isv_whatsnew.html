<h2>What's New in 3.2</h2>

<p>Here are descriptions of some of the changes of interest to plug-in developers
made to the Eclipse <a href="#Platform">Platform</a> and
<a href="#SWT">SWT</a> for the 3.2 release of Eclipse.</p>

<p>
There are also many new features oriented towards end-users of the platform
that can be viewed in the 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/whatsNew/platform_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
section of the Workbench User Guide.

		fields in a dialog, showing field-based error conditions, or showing content-assist 
		prompts.  The package also allows you to install content proposals on a control, 
		including a pop-up dialog with content proposals, secondary pop-ups for further information,

      markup for on-the-fly filtering of content based on os/ws/arch values, presence 
      of plug-ins, enabled capabilities, etc. Shared content can be included into 
      multiple documents. Finally, plug-ins can contribute XHTML fragments that 
      plug into anchors in other documents. All this now enables information developers 
      to provide dynamic documents that tailor themselves to the context at the

      an XHTML search participant that can index dynamic help documents authored 
      in XHMTL (see above). In addition, documents that were previously not in 
      the index will now appear (for example, cheat sheets and Welcome pages). Search 
      hits can now have different icons and the 'open' action can be delegated 
      to the search engine.</p>

      same as pressing F1 (on Windows). In addition, the help content will now 
      appear in the dialog's tray instead of in a separate 
      window. Custom dialogs can inherit this functionality by subclassing the 
      new <tt>TrayDialog</tt> class rather than <tt>Dialog</tt>. Cheatsheets can also follow you 
      into dialogs (in the tray) for those steps that involve opening dialogs.

      more uses of command links are possible. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Workbench

      the XHTML content. After this conversion, users can take advantage of the 
      new 3.2 Help features such as dynamic content filtering, content reuse, 
      and dynamic content contribution that all require XHTML as the content format.

      Migrate (Eclipse SDK uses 4 of them). Universal Welcome has configurable 
      page layouts and importance levels for each contribution, and is fully theme-aware. 
      It also offers both HTML and SWT presentations for 100% platform coverage. 
      <p> A Welcome preference page provided by Universal Welcome opens up Welcome 
        customization to the end users, and can be included in any product that 
        wants to offer it. You can read more about this in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-ua/proposals/shared-intro/shared-intro.htm">

      be used by other Welcome implementations. 
      <p>Themes represent named collections of CSS files, properties, and images 
        that collectively define the look of the Welcome content. Universal Welcome 
        takes advantage of this support by providing theme selection capability
