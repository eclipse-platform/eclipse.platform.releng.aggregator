<title>Eclipse Platform What's New in Kepler (SWT and Plug-in Developers)</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>What's New in Kepler</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the changes of interest to plug-in developers
made to the Eclipse <a href="#Platform">Platform</a>, <a href="#Equinox">Equinox</a> and
<a href="#SWT">SWT</a> for the Kepler (4.3) release of Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
There are also many new features oriented towards end-users of the platform
that can be viewed in the 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/whatsNew/platform_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
section of the Workbench User Guide.

    <td class="title">Initial Eclipse 4 API released</td>
    <td class="content">
      The first set of official API based on the new Eclipse Platform 4 architecture is now available. 
      This is the first step in allowing developers to use the new simpler and more powerful mechanisms 
      to build Eclipse plug-ins and applications.
    <p>
      This API is comprised of two basic concepts:
    </p><p>
      <b>The user interface model</b>: The content of this model describes the structure of the user interface.
      The Eclipse Platform reacts to changes in this model by updating the presentation, and the complete
      model is now available through the new API.
    </p><p>
      Note that the model represents everything on the screen and these elements can be modified
      by your code (see the example below).
    </p><p>
      <b>IEclipseContext / Dependency Injection (DI)</b>: Contexts are containers of UI runtime state
      including all the available services. The typical Eclipse Platform 4 pattern is that contributions
      are created and configured through dependency injection based on state and services found in the local
      context for that model element.
    </p><p>
      Here are a few links to more information about the UI Model, the services and DI (the Javadoc and supporting
      Eclipse documentation will be available before Kepler is released):

    </ul>
    <p>
      There is quite a lot of information already available for Eclipse Platform 4. While parts of the API are just being
      formalized now, most of the concepts and API existed in provisional form in previous Eclipse 4 releases.
    </p><p>
      Just to give a taste of what working in a modeled UI is all about, here's a code snippet showing
      how to get a 'standard' Command handler to toggle the visibility of the 'Quick Access' text field
      that appears in the top trim. First we gain access to the model by getting the MApplication as a
      'service'. Form there we can access the EModelService and use it to find the model element
      representing the search in the UI. Then it's just a simple matter of toggling the element's
      'toBeRendered' flag to get it to (dis)appear.
    </p>
    <pre>
public Object execute(ExecutionEvent event) throws ExecutionException {
  IWorkbenchWindow window = HandlerUtil.getActiveWorkbenchWindowChecked(event);		
  MApplication theApp = (MApplication) window.getService(MApplication.class);
  MWindow activeWin = theApp.getSelectedElement();
  EModelService ms = activeWin.getContext().get(EModelService.class);
  EPartService ps = activeWin.getContext().get(EPartService.class);
  MToolControl search = (MToolControl) ms.find("SearchField", activeWin);
  if (search != null) {
    search.setToBeRendered(!search.isToBeRendered());
    window.getShell().layout(true, true);
  }
  return null;
}

      The Eclipse platform help system has migrated from Lucene 2.9.1 to Lucene 3.5.
      This change brings improved performance and many bug fixes in help search.
      Some old help system API related to Lucene has been changed or removed as part
      of this fix. Refer to the platform 4.3 migration guide for more details.
