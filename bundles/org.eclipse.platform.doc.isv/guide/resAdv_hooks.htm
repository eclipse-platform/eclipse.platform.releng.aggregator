Resource modification hooks</H2>
<P >So far, we've assumed that resource API is being used to modify resources
that are located in the user's file system.&nbsp; This is indeed the fundamental
structure of the workspace, but it's also possible that a plug-in adds
capabilities for manipulation of resources that are managed somewhere
else.&nbsp; For example, the platform <a href="team.htm">Team support</a>
plug-ins add the ability to work with resources that are under the management of
a versioning repository.</P>

<P > The resource API includes capabilities that have been added specifically 
  to enable the team support plug-ins and plug-ins that implement repository providers 
  using the team support.&nbsp; The following discussion covers the generic mechanism 
  for registering resource hooks.&nbsp; See <a href="team_provider_repository.htm#hooks">Implementing 
  a repository provider</a> for a discussion of how team uses these hooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<h3 >
Resource move/delete hooks</h3>

<P >
This hook allows the team plug-in and its providers to control
    how resource moves and deletes are implemented.&nbsp; The hook includes the ability to prevent
these operations from
    happening.&nbsp; Implementors can provide alternate implementations for
    moving or deleting files, folders, and projects.&nbsp;</P>

<P >
The team plug-in uses the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_moveDeleteHook.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.resources.moveDeleteHook</b></a>
extension point to register its hook:</P>

<pre ><font color="#4444CC">&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.moveDeleteHook&quot; id=&quot;MoveDeleteHook&quot;&gt;
	&lt;moveDeleteHook class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.core.MoveDeleteManager&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</font>
</pre>

<P >
The supplied class must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/team/IMoveDeleteHook.html"><b>IMoveDeleteHook</b></a>,
which is called by the platform whenever a resource is moved or deleted.&nbsp;
The team plug-in installs a move delete hook manager that can determine which
team provider is managing a resource and invoke its specific hook.</P>

<blockquote>

  <P ><i>Note:&nbsp; The move delete hook was designed specifically for use by the 
    team core plug-in and other team repository provider clients.&nbsp; It is 
    not intended for general use.&nbsp; Team providers should not install the 
    hook using the extension point, but instead implement their hook in their 
    RepositoryProvider class.&nbsp; See <a href="team_provider_repository.htm#hooks">Team 
    resource modification hooks</a> for more information about using these hooks.</i></P>

</blockquote>

<h3 >
File modification validators</h3>

<p>It's also possible that team repository providers will need to prevent or
intervene in the editing or saving of a file.&nbsp; The team plug-in
accomplishes this by using the extension point <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_resources_moveDeleteHook.html"><b>org.eclipse.core.resources.fileModificationValidator</b></a>
to register a validator that is called whenever a resource is to be modified.</p>

<pre ><font color="#4444CC">&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.fileModificationValidator&quot; id=&quot;FileValidator&quot;&gt;
	&lt;fileModificationValidator class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.core.FileModificationValidatorManager&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</font></pre>

<P >The supplied class must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IFileModificationValidator.html"><b>IFileModificationValidator</b></a>,
which is called by the platform whenever a resource is saved or
opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The team plug-in installs a file modification manager that
can determine which team provider is managing a resource and invoke its specific
validator.</P>

<blockquote>

  <P ><i>Note:&nbsp; The file modification validator hook was designed specifically 
    for use by the team core plug-in.&nbsp; It is not intended for general use.&nbsp; 
    Team providers should not install the hook using the extension point, but 
    instead implement their hook in their Repository Provider class.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    See <a href="team_provider_repository.htm#hooks">Team resource modification 
    hooks</a> for more information about using these hooks.</i></P>
