<h3>Primary feature</h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&lt;this needs to be prefaced with notes that identify it as the legacy approach.
  It is fully supported but is left in place for people with existing products.
  There will be some level of updating needed to the details as some files have
  moved/been renamed, ..&gt;</font></p>
<p>When the Eclipse platform is started, exactly one feature gets to control
  the overall &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;branding&quot; of the platform,
  including the splash screen, window images, about box, welcome page, and other
  customizable aspects of the platform.&nbsp; This feature is called the product's <b>primary feature</b>.</p>
<p>Let's look again at the description of the platform feature in its platform
manifest:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">feature 
	id=&quot;org.eclipse.platform&quot; 
	label=&quot;%featureName&quot; 
	version=&quot;2.0.0&quot; 
	provider-name=&quot;%providerName&quot; 
	<b>primary=&quot;true&quot;</b> 
	application=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.workbench&quot;&gt;</font></pre>
<p>The platform feature has been designated as a primary feature. Although it's
possible to designate many features as primary features in their <b>feature.xml</b> 
files,
only one primary feature gets control when the platform is launched.&nbsp; This
is controlled in the product's <b>install.ini </b>file underneath the <b>eclipse</b>
directory.&nbsp; The <b>feature.default.id</b> property in this file designates
the primary feature for the product.&nbsp; Typically, a product only defines branding information for
one feature and designates this feature in the <b>install.ini </b>file.&nbsp;
(If there are multiple eligible primary features, the <b>-feature </b>command
line option for <b>eclipse.exe</b> overrides the choice made in <b>install.ini</b>.) </p>
<p>The branding information for the feature is located in a plug-in of the same
name as the primary feature.&nbsp; The files that designate and define branding
information for our hypothetical acmeweb application are highlighted in the
sample directory structure below:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">acmeweb/
	<b>acmeweb.exe	</b></font>(product executable - invokes eclipse.exe and specifies the primary feature)
	<font color="#4444CC">eclipse/</font>
		<font color="#4444CC">.eclipseproduct</font>
		<font color="#4444CC">eclipse.exe
		startup.jar
		install.ini
		.config/
		platform.cfg
		jre/
		features/</font>
			<font color="#4444CC"><b>com.example.acme.acmefeature_1.0.0/</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>(primary feature)<font color="#4444CC">
				feature.xml
			org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/
			org.eclipse.platform.win32_2.0.0/
		plugins/
			<b>com.example.acme.acmefeature_1.0.0/</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>(plug-in for primary feature.  Contains branding info.)<font color="#4444CC">
				plugin.xml
				<b>about.ini
				about.html
				about.mappings
				about.properties
				acme.gif
				plugin_customization.ini
				splash.jpg
				welcome.xml</b>
			com.example.acme.acmewebsupport_1.0.0/
			org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/
