<H1>Component Framework</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> By providing simple API for views and editors, also known as 
  parts, the Component Framework permits existing parts to be nested and composed. 
  The Component Framework API allows clients to instantiate parts inside arbitrary 
  SWT composites, improves robustness and leak proofing by having a part communicate 
  with local interfaces on its site rather than reaching to global objects, allows 
  clients to extend the set of interfaces available from a site and provides a 
  framework for clients to create their own reusable components using the same 
  API available to views and editors. The Component Framework also allows for 
  constructing and destructing a part with atomic operations and allows existing 
  parts to use new site interfaces.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"><img alt="Image of NameViewNew view" src="images/NameViewNew.PNG"><br>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">This simple example provides a view that sets its name, title, 
  tooltip, and image and demonstrates how to write an editor or view using the 
  component framework. It shows the source using the component API. New parts 
  can take arguments in their constructor and do not need to implement any particular 
  interface or need to inherit from any particular base class.<br>
  <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>/**<br>
  &nbsp;* Sample view that sets its name, tooltip, image, and content description. 
  The view<br>
  &nbsp;* uses a custom image supplied by its plug-in.<br>
  &nbsp;* <br>
  &nbsp;* @since 3.1<br>
  &nbsp;*/<br>
  public class NameViewNew {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Component constructor. Do not invoke directly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; */<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public NameViewNew(Composite parent, INameable name, IPluginImages 
  images) {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.setName("Name View (New)");<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.setContentDescription("content description");<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.setTooltip("This is a tooltip");<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.setImage(images.getImage("icons/sample.gif"));<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Create some bogus view contents<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label content = new Label(parent, SWT.NONE);<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content.setText("View contents go here");<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
  }</code><br>
</div><p>Notice that the arguments given to the view's constructor are already aware 
  of their context. For example, the IPluginImages interface does not need to 
  be told which plug-in the view belongs to. Similarly, the interfaces are resistant 
  to leaks. In this example, the view's image is allocated and deallocated automatically 
  by the INameable implementation, so the view itself doesn't need to implement 
  a dispose method.<br>
  <br>
  It is interesting to note that the API for views and editors is exactly the 
  same. In other words, if we had chosen to register the NameViewNew class with 
  the org.eclipse.ui.editors extension point, it could also be used as an editor 
  without further modification.<br>
