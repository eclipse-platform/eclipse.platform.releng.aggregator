<p>
If your plug-in defines and manipulates its own resource types, you may have
special requirements for comparing resources.&nbsp; Resources are often compared
when working with local history or with files from a repository.&nbsp; The <b>compare</b>
plug-in supports merging of multiple content streams and the implementation of advanced compare views.
Services provided by this plug-in include:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Interfaces for merging multiple text streams into a single output stream</li>
  <li>Two and three-way compare and merge components for hierarchical structures
    inferred from text</li>
  <li>Differencing engines for hierarchical structures and character ranges in
    text</li>
</ul>
<p>These services are used in the platform to assist with user tasks such as
integrating patch files and comparing/merging the workspace with local history.</p>
<h2>Compare viewers</h2>
<p>
All compare viewers are standard <a href="jface_viewers.htm"> JFace viewers</a> that expect an input object implementing the
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/compare/structuremergeviewer/ICompareInput.html">ICompareInput</b></a>
interface.</p>
<p>
Compare viewers are said to be
<a href="compare_contentviewer.htm">content-oriented</a>  if they compare flat
inputs such as text or images and
<a href="compare_structureviewer.htm">structure-oriented</a>  if they compare
hierarchically structured input elements.</p>
