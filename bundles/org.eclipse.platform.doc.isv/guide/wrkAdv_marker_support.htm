<h2>Support for displaying markers</h2>
<p>The <a
	href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_ide_markerSupport.html">org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport</a>
extension point provides facilities for controlling how markers are
displayed and organized in the UI. This extension point handles filters
and grouping in views such as the Problems view as well as definition of custom marker views.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Content Generators</strong></p>

<p>Custom marker views can be created by specifying the view using a
<tt>markerContentsGenerator</tt>. A <tt>markerContentsGenerator</tt>
specifies the types used, the configurations available and the grouping
to be shown in the view. The problems view, tasks view and bookmarks
view are defined using <tt>markerContentsGenerator</tt> as of version
3.4. A reusable superclass <tt>org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.AbstractMarkersView</tt>
has been supplied for use by custom <tt>markerContentsGenerators</tt>.</p>
<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>
The menus defined in the markersViews now all use the
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.menus</tt>
extension point so they can be extended by clients at any desired point.
The pop-up menus in the supplied markers views are available to all
subclasses of
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.AbstractMarkersView</tt>
but pull-down entries must be added for the new views explicitly. It is
recommended that all new handlers for commands to be added to the
markersView subclass
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.MarkerViewHandler</tt>
so as to get access to the
<tt>org.eclipse.core.resources.IMarkers</tt>
currently selected.

<p><strong>Configurations</strong></p>
<p>The Problems view supports multiple configurations at once. When
multiple configurations are enabled there are two possible modes of
matching: <i>match any</i> (any marker that matches one or more selected
filters will be displayed) or <i>match all</i> (any marker that matches all
selected filters will be displayed). New configurations can be added
using the <tt>markerFieldConfiguration</tt> element or manually by the
user. Below is the configuration section of the Problems view showing
user configurations and configurations added via the extension point).</p>

<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
<p>Markers can be grouped in two ways. The first way is to group
marker types into groups using the <code>markerTypeCategory</code>
element. This is shown when the user selects <b>Group By &gt; Type</b>.
Below is an example that shows grouping by 'Java Problem Type':</p>
<p><img src="images/prob.png" alt="Picture of Problems view showing grouping by type"></p>
<p>When marker types are grouped together they will be shown in
those groups in the configurations dialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/problems_view_markerTypeCat.png" alt="Picture of Problems view's 'Configure Contents' dialog"></p>
<p>You can also create your own grouping using the <code>markerGrouping</code>
element, which will show up as an extra entry in the <b>Group By</b>
menu of the markers view it is defined in. Top level markerGroupings are
shown in the Problems View (this is for compatibility with previous
Eclipse versions). The IDE provides a grouping based on severity (the
default). The Java development tools provide a Java Type grouping.</p>
<p><code>markerGroupings</code> are resolved by checking attributes
on the <a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IMarker.html">IMarker</a>.
<code>markerAttributeMappings</code> are used to specify these mappings.
Below is the Group By menu with the extra <code>markerGroupings</code>
that have been added. The Problems view is currently grouped by
severity.</p>
