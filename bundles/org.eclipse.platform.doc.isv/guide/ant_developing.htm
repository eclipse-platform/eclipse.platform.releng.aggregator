<h2>
Developing Ant tasks and types within Eclipse</h2><p>The following guidelines should be followed when developing and debugging Ant 
  tasks and types within Eclipse. These requirements stem from the fact that Ant 
  tasks and types must be loaded by the Ant classloader, rather than a plug-in 
  classloader, when Ant is run in the same VM as Eclipse. To avoid having the 
  Ant tasks and types loaded by a plug-in classloader, the tasks and types need 
  to be stored in a location that is not visible to any plug-in classloader. Also 
  see <a href="ant_contributing_task.htm">Contributing tasks and types</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Contributed Ant tasks or types should be defined in their own source folder 
    within a plug-in (i.e. separate from the source folders containing regular 
    plug-in classes)</li>
  <li>Each source folder containing the Ant tasks and types should have its own 
    output location that does not overlap with the output location of the regular 
    plug-in classes.</li>
  <li>When testing/debugging the new Ant tasks or types, the project contributing
    the Ant tasks or types must be configured to <b>exclude</b> the output folders 
    containing the Ant tasks and types. Use the <b>Properties</b> dialog for the project to
    correctly configure the <b>Self-Hosting</b> configuration by removing the Ant output 
    directories from the plug-ins classpath.</li>
</ul>
