Installing and running the plug-in</H2>
<P >
Let's put everything together so that we can run our new plug-in.&nbsp; </P>
<P > First, we need to compile our classes into a jar called <b>helloworld.jar</b>. 
  Why? Because that's where we told the platform our plug-in could be found.&nbsp;You 
  can do this by selecting the project, choosing <b>File &gt; Export</b> and exporting 
  your generated class file to a <b>JAR File</b>.&nbsp; </P>
<P > Next, we install the plug-in into a directory underneath the platform's plug-in 
  directory. This directory corresponds to our plug-in id, which must be unique.&nbsp; 
  The standard practice for plug-in directory names is to use the plug-in's fully 
  qualified id, including the dots.&nbsp; In this case, we need to create a directory 
  named <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</b> inside the platform's plug-in directory. 
  (The plug-in directory is named <b>plugins</b> and is typically located underneath 
  the main directory where you installed the platform.) We copy the <b> helloworld.jar</b> 
  and the <b> plugin.xml</b> to this new directory.&nbsp; (You can export the 
  <b>plugin.xml</b> to the file system using the <b>File &gt; Export</b> wizard 
  with destination type <strong>File system</strong>.) </P>
<P >

<P >If you are currently running the workbench, you will need to shut it down
and restart it.&nbsp; When the platform starts, it assembles a list of all of the plug-ins installed in the system, called the plug-in registry. This registry keeps track of plug-ins and the extension points that they contribute.&nbsp;
Restarting the workbench will cause it to find your new plug-in.</P>
<P >(Note:&nbsp; We are installing our plug-in and launching the workbench ourselves to show
exactly how plug-ins are installed and found in the platform.&nbsp; The PDE
plug-in automates much of this process by introducing a special launcher that
launches a self-hosted workbench.&nbsp; We are ignoring this for now to keep
things simple.)&nbsp;</P>
<P > How do we run the plug-in?&nbsp; We can see all of the views that have been 
  contributed by plug-ins using the <b>Window &gt;Show View</b> menu.</P>

<img src="images/perspectivemenu.gif" alt="" border="0" width="425" height="349">
<P >
This menu shows us what views are available for the current perspective. You can see all of the views that are contributed to the platform (regardless of perspective) by selecting
<b>Other...</b>. This will display a list of view categories and the views available under each category. </P>
<P >
The workbench creates the full list of views by using the plug-in registry to
find all the plug-ins that have provided extensions for the
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_views.html"><b> org.eclipse.ui.views</b></a> extension point. </P>

<img src="images/showview.gif" alt="Show View dialog with Hello entry" border="0" width="297" height="422">
<P >
There we are! The view called &quot;Hello Greetings&quot; has been added to the <b> Show View</b> window underneath our category &quot;Hello.&quot; The labels for our category and view were obtained from the extension point configuration markup in the
<b>plugin.xml</b>. </P>
<P ><i><b>
Up to this point, we still have not run our plug-in code!&nbsp; </b></i>The
declarations in the <b>plugin.xml </b>(which can be
accessed via the plug-in registry) are enough for the workbench to know that there is a view called &quot;Hello View&quot; available in the &quot;Hello&quot; category. It knows what class implements the view. But none of our code will be run until we decide to
show the view.</P>
<P >
If we choose the &quot;Hello Greetings' view from the <b> Show View</b> list, the
workbench will
activate our plug-in, instantiate and initialize our view class, and show the
new view in the workbench along with all of the other views. Now our code is running.&nbsp;</P>

<P >
There it is, our first plug-in! We'll cover more specifics about UI classes and extension points later on.</P>
