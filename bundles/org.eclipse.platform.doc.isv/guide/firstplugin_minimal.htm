A minimal plug-in</H2>
<P >
We all know what &quot;Hello World&quot; looks like in plain old Java without using any user interface frameworks or
other specialized libraries.</P>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
      }
   }
</pre></font>
<P >
What happens to this old standard in the context of the Eclipse platform?  Instead of thinking of Hello World as a self-contained program, we recast it as an extension of the platform. Since we want to say hello to the world, we need to figure out how to extend the workbench to include our greeting.</P>
<P >
When we get deeper into the platform user interface components, we'll do an exhaustive review of the ways that you can extend and customize the workbench
UI. For now, let's start with one of the simplest workbench extensions - a view.&nbsp;</P>

<i><blockquote>
Note:&nbsp; For simplicity, we'll create a plug-in that extends the IDE workbench as it comes "out of the box"
in the SDK.  <a HREF="rcp_hello.htm">Revisiting hello world</a> shows how to develop this application in a minimal workbench using the subset of plug-ins
known as the <a HREF="arch_rcp.htm">Rich Client Platform</a>.</blockquote></i>


<p>You can think of the workbench window as a frame that presents various visual
parts. These parts fall into two major categories: views and editors.&nbsp; We
will look at editors later.&nbsp; <b>Views</b>
provide information about some object that the user is working with in the
workbench. Views often change their content as the user selects different
objects in the workbench.</p>

<H3>
Hello world view</H3>
<P >
For our hello world plug-in, we will implement our own view to greet the user with &quot;Hello World.&quot;</P>
<P >
The plug-in <b>org.eclipse.ui.workbench</b> defines most of the public interfaces that make up the workbench
user interface (UI) API. These interfaces can be found in the package <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/package-summary.html"> org.eclipse.ui</a></b>
and its sub packages.  Many of these interfaces have
default implementation classes that you can extend to provide simple modifications to the system. In our hello world example, we will extend a workbench view to provide a label that says hello.</P>
<P >
The interface of interest is <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IViewPart.html">IViewPart</a></b>, which defines the methods that must be implemented to contribute a view to the workbench. The class
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/part/ViewPart.html">ViewPart</a></b> provides a default implementation of this interface. In a nutshell, a view part is responsible for creating the widgets needed to show the view.</P>
<P > The standard views in the workbench often display some information about 
  an object that the user has selected or is navigating. Views update their contents 
  based on actions that occur in the workbench. In our case, we are just saying 
  hello, so our view is quite simple.</P>
<h4 >Using the tools to write our plug-in</h4>
<P >You can use any Java IDE you wish to build Eclipse plug-ins, but we'll walk 
  through the steps for building our plug-in with the Eclipse Java IDE.&nbsp; 
  If you are not already familiar with the Eclipse workbench and the Java IDE, 
  consult the Java Development User Guide for further explanations of the steps 
  we are taking.&nbsp; For now we are focusing on the code, not the tool.&nbsp; 
  However, there are some IDE logistics for getting started.</P>
<h4 >Setting up your environment</h4>
<p >If you are starting with a clean environment, you will need to ensure that 
  your code has access to the plug-in <b>org.eclipse.ui.ide</b>. This is the plug-in that supplies
  the default platform workbench.  Import this plug-in and any plug-ins it requires into 
  your run-time workbench instance by performing the steps below. If you already 
  have these plug-ins loaded in your workspace, proceed to the section &quot;Creating 
  your plug-in project&quot;.</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the resource perspective, use <strong>File &gt; Import... &gt; External 
    Plug-ins and Fragments</strong>.</li>
  <li>Continue clicking on the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> buttons until you get 
    to the screen called <strong>Selection</strong>. This screen will contain 
    a list of all of the plug-ins in your host workbench instance.</li>
  <li>Select <b>org.eclipse.ui.ide</b> and then click the button <strong>Add<strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on the button <strong>Required Plug-ins</strong>.  The list on the right should fill up with all the plug-ins that org.eclipse.ide requires.</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Finish</strong> button. Your Navigator view should 
    contain org.eclipse.ui.ide and all of the plug-ins it requires (such as org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.swt, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>For a complete discussion of setting up host and run-time workbench instances 
  consult the PDE Guide.</p>
<h4>Creating your plug-in project</h4>
<ol>
  <li>You will need to create a project to do your work.&nbsp; The simplest way 
    is to open the <b>New Project...</b> wizard (<strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</strong>) 
    and choose <b>Plug-in Project </b>from the <b>Plug-in Development</b> category.&nbsp; 
    This will set up your project for writing Java code and give you a default 
    plug-in manifest file (explained in a moment.)&nbsp; Use <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</b> 
    as the name for your project and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Plug-in Project Structure</strong> page, click <strong>Next</strong> to
   accept the defaults (creation of a Java project).</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Plug-in Content</strong> page, look at the default settings.  The wizard sets <strong>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</strong> 
    as the id of the plug-in.&nbsp; The wizard will also generate a plug-in class for your plug-in.  These defaults are
    acceptable, so click <strong>Next</strong>.  </li>
  <li>On the <strong>Templates</strong> page, check the box for <strong>Create a plug-in using one of the templates</strong>.  Then
    select the <strong>Plug-in with a view</strong> template.  Click <strong>Next</strong>.  </li>
  <li>On the <strong>Main View Settings</strong> page, check the box for <strong>Create a plug-in using one of the templates</strong>.  Then
    select the <strong>Plug-in with a view</strong> template.  Click <strong>Next</strong>.  </li>
  <li>When asked if you would like to switch to the Plug-in Development perspective, 
    answer <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
  <li>Navigate to your new project and notice that you now have a package <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</b> underneath the <b>src</b> 
    directory for the project. </li>
  <li>Create a new class called <b>HelloWorldView</b> in this package. Right click 
    on the package to get the context menu. 
    Use <strong>New &gt; Class</strong> to create your new class with the name 
    <b>HelloWorldView</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Writing the code</h4>
<P >Now we're ready to study some code.&nbsp; Here is everything you need in
your <b>HelloWorldView</b>.&nbsp; (You can copy the contents below into the
class you created, replacing any auto-generated content.)&nbsp;</P>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   package org.eclipse.examples.helloworld;

   import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite;
   import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label;
   import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
   import org.eclipse.ui.part.ViewPart;

   public class HelloWorldView extends ViewPart {
      Label label;
      public HelloWorldView() {
      }
      public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
         label = new Label(parent, SWT.WRAP);
         label.setText(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
      }
      public void setFocus() {
         // set focus to my widget.  For a label, this doesn't
         // make much sense, but for more complex sets of widgets
         // you would decide which one gets the focus.
      }
   }
</pre></font>
<P >
The view part creates the widgets that will represent it in the <b> createPartControl</b> method. In this example, we create an SWT label and set the &quot;Hello World&quot; text into it.&nbsp;</P>
<P >
This is all we need!&nbsp; We can compile our new class, but we better make sure
that our .classpath is set up properly so that we can compile the
code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloWorld</b> project and open the <b>Properties</b> 
    dialog (right click on the project <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloWorld</b> 
    <strong>&gt; Properties</strong>).</li>
  <li>In the <b>Java Build Path</b> properties, select the <b>Projects</b> tab, 
    and check the projects&nbsp; <b>org.eclipse.ui</b> and <b>org.eclipse.swt</b>. 
    These are the projects that contain the classes we imported.</li>
  <li><b>Rebuild</b> the project.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<P >
Okay, so we've compiled the view.&nbsp; Our new view is supposed to look something like this:</P>

<p>

<img src="images/hello.gif" alt="Simple view that says Hello World" border="0" width="377" height="120">
</p>
<P >
How do we run the code and add this view to the workbench?</P>



<H3>
The hello world plug-in</H3>
<P >
We need to inform the platform that we want to contribute our view. 
The plug-in <b>org.eclipse.ui</b> defines most of the extension points that can be used
to contribute to the workbench UI.  Our view is added by extending the
<b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_views.html"> org.eclipse.ui.views</a></b> extension point. We register our extension by providing a manifest file,<b>
plugin.xml</b>, which describes our plug-in, including where its code is located, and the extension
we are adding.</P>
<P >
(If you are still following along, you can copy this information into the <b>plugin.xml
</b>that was generated when you created the project.  Click on the <strong>plugin.xml</strong> tab
inside the plugin.xml editor and copy the following information just before the <strong>&lt;/plugin&gt</strong>.)</P>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
      &lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.views&quot;&gt;
         &lt;category 
            id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.hello&quot;
            name=&quot;Hello&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;view 
            id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.helloworldview&quot;
            name=&quot;Hello Greetings&quot;
            category=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.hello&quot;
            class=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldView&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre></font>
<P >
The wizard automatically generated a <b>name</b>, <b>id</b>, and <b>version</b> for our plug-in. </P>
<P >
It required plug-ins. Since we use workbench and SWT API in our
plug-in, we must list
<b>org.eclipse.ui</b>. We must also describe where our executable code is located.
We intend to package the code in
<b>helloworld.jar</b>, so we register that as our <b>library</b> name.</P>
<P >
Finally, we declare what extension point our plug-in is contributing. The <b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_views.html"> org.eclipse.ui.views</a></b> extension has several different configuration parameters.
We first declare a <b> category</b> for our view extension. Categories can be used to group related views together in the workbench
<b> Show View</b> dialog. We define our own category, &quot;Hello,&quot; so that it will display in its own group.&nbsp;
We declare a unique <b> id</b> for our view and specify the name of the
<b> class</b> that provides the implementation of the view. We also specify a
<b> name</b> for the view, &quot;Hello Greetings&quot; which will be shown in the Show View dialog and in our view's title bar.</P>

<h4 >
<a name="firstplugin_minimal_pluginid">Plug-in ids</a></h4>
<P>
There are many ids used in a plug-in manifest file. Individual extension points often define configuration parameters that require ids (such as the category id used above for the views extension point). We also define a plug-in id. In general, you should use Java package name prefixes for all of your ids in order to ensure uniqueness among all the
installed plug-ins.&nbsp;</P>

<P>
 The specific name that you use after the prefix is completely up to you.
However, if your plug-in id prefix is exactly the same name as one of your packages, you
should avoid using class names from that package.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise it will become difficult to tell whether you are looking at an id name or a class name.&nbsp;</P>

<P>
 You should also avoid using the same id for different extension configuration parameters.
In the above manifest, we have used a common id prefix (<b>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</b>)
but all of our ids are unique.&nbsp; This naming approach helps us to read the
file and see which ids are related.&nbsp; </P>

<h4>
 What next? </h4>

<P>
 At this point, we have implemented a view and declared our contribution in our
 plug-in manifest.&nbsp; Now we need to install our plug-in into the platform so
 that we can run it. </P>
