<h1>Platform architecture </h1>

<p>The Eclipse platform is structured around the concept of <b>extension points</b>.&nbsp;
Extension points are well-defined places in the system where other tools (called
<b>plug-ins</b>) can contribute functionality.</p>


<p>Each major subsystem in the platform is itself structured as a set of plug-ins that implement
some key function and define extension points.&nbsp; The Eclipse system itself is built by contributing to the same
extension points that third party plug-in providers can use.&nbsp; Plug-ins can
define their own extension points or simply add <b>extensions</b> to the
extension points of other plug-ins.</p>


<p>The platform subsystems typically add visible
features to the platform and provide APIs for extending their
functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these components supply additional class libraries that
do not directly relate to an extension point, but can be used to implement
extensions.&nbsp; For example, the workbench UI supplies the JFace UI
framework and the SWT widget toolkit. </p>


<p>The Eclipse SDK includes the basic platform plus two major tools that are
useful for plug-in development.&nbsp; The Java development tooling (JDT)
implements a full featured Java development environment.&nbsp; The Plug-in
Developer Environment (PDE) adds specialized tools that streamline the
development of plug-ins and extensions.</p>


<p>These tools not only serve a useful purpose, but also provide a great example of
how new tools can be added to the platform by building plug-ins that extend the
system.</p>
