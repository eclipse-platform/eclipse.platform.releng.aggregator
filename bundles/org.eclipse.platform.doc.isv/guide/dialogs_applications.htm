<h2>
Application dialogs</h2><P >
When a standard dialog is too simple for your plug-in, you can build your own dialog using the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/Dialog.html"><b> Dialog</b></a> class. Earlier, we saw how the readme tool contributed an &quot;Open Readme Browser&quot;
action in an action set.&nbsp; This action set is shown in the workbench tool bar
and <b>Window-&gt;Readme File Editor</b> menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P >
Now we are ready to look at the implementation of this action in the readme
tool's <b>WindowActionDelegate</b>.</P>

<pre>
   public void run(IAction action) {
      SectionsDialog dialog = new SectionsDialog(window.getShell(),
         ReadmeModelFactory.getInstance().getSections(selection));
      dialog.open();
   }
</pre>

<P >
The window action delegate for the action set uses the current selection in the resource navigator view (the
<b> .readme</b> file) to get a list of sections in the readme file. This list and the
workbench window's shell are passed to the
<b>SectionsDialog</b>.&nbsp;</P>

<P >
When the user selects the action, the <b>SectionsDialog</b>
is opened.</P>

<P >
 The <b> SectionsDialog</b> is implemented in the readme tool plug-in by subclassing the
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/Dialog.html"> Dialog</a>
</b> class in the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/package-summary.html"> org.eclipse.jface.dialogs</a>
package.</b></P>
<P >
The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/Dialog.html"><b> Dialog</b></a> class provides basic support for building a dialog shell window, creating the common dialog buttons, and launching the dialog. The subclasses are responsible for handling the content of the dialog itself:</P>
<ul>
  <li><b>createDialogArea</b> creates the SWT controls that represent the dialog contents. This is similar to creating the controls for a view or
    editor.
<P > <P >
The <b> SectionsDialog</b> creates an SWT list to display the list of sections. It uses a JFace viewer to populate the list. (We'll look at JFace viewers in
<a HREF="jface_viewers.htm" CLASS="XRef"> Viewers</a>.) Note that our dialog does not have to create any of the buttons for the dialog since this is done by our
superclass.</P>
<pre>
   protected Control createDialogArea(Composite parent) {
      Composite composite = (Composite)super.createDialogArea(parent);
      List list = new List(composite, SWT.BORDER);
      ...
      ListViewer viewer = new ListViewer(list);
      ...
      return composite;
   }
</pre>
<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>configureShell</b> is overridden to set an appropriate title for the shell window.
<pre>
   protected void configureShell(Shell newShell) {
      super.configureShell(newShell);
      newShell.setText(MessageUtil.getString(&quot;Readme Sections&quot;));
      ...
   }
</pre>
<br>
  </li>
  <li>
<b>
okButtonPressed</b> is overridden to perform whatever action is necessary when the user presses the OK button. (You can also override
<b> cancelButtonPressed</b> or <b> buttonPressed(int)</b> depending on the design of your dialog.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<b>SectionsDialog</b> does not implement an <b> okButtonPressed</b> method. It inherits the &quot;do-nothing&quot; implementation from
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/Dialog.html"><b>Dialog</b></a>. This is not typical. Your dialog usually performs some processing in response to one of the dialog buttons being pressed.
<P >
Dialogs can be as simple or as complicated as necessary. When you implement a dialog, most of your dialog code is concerned with creating the SWT controls that represent its content area and handling any events necessary while the dialog is up. Once a button is pressed by the user, the dialog can query the state of the various controls (or viewers) that make up the dialog to determine what to do.</P>
