<H2> Adding new interfaces</H2>
New types of objects can be passed into a part's constructor by registering them 
with the the <span style="font-style: italic;">org.eclipse.core.component.types</span> 
extension point. At this point, we should introduce the term <span
 style="font-style: italic;">component</span>. A component is any sort of object 
that is created from an extension point by injecting arguments into its constructor. 
New-style parts are one sort of component, but there are other types of components 
as well.<br>
<br>
The following example shows a sample types extension. This example specifies that 
the INameable interface should be available from a part's site.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>&lt;extension</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point="org.eclipse.core.component.types"&gt;</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;component<br>
  </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initializer="org.eclipse.ui.part.SiteInitializer"</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface="org.eclipse.ui.part.services.INameable"<br>
  </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implementation="org.eclipse.ui.internal.part.services.NullNameableService"</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; singleton="true"</code><br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; /&gt;</code><br>
  <code>&lt;/extension&gt;</code><br>
</div><p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">initializer</span> attribute indicates 
  where the interface will be used. For example, the string "org.eclipse.ui.part.SiteInitializer" 
  means that the interface is used on a part's site. We could have also used "org.eclipse.ui.part.PartInitializer" 
  if the interface was intended for parts themselves to implement. <br>
  <br>
  The <span style="font-style: italic;">interface</span> attribute is the name 
  of the interface. This must exactly match the type that the component will receive 
  in its constructor. If we create an extension that supplies Strings and a component 
  asks for an Object, it will not use our extension even though it would have 
  been a compatible type. <br>
  <br>
  The <span style="font-style: italic;">implementation</span> attribute identifies 
  the default implementation of the interface. It either points to a component 
  class that implements the interface or a ComponentFactory that can create them, 
  for additional information, see the ComponentFactory section . This implementation 
  is used to satisfy a dependency whenever a component requests this interface 
  and it can't be found in its parent context. All interfaces must supply a default 
  implementation. This means that a correctly written component will always work 
  in a given scope, regardless of how many dependencies are supplied by its parent 
  context. The implementation cannot override or extend the interface attribute 
  by implementing additional interfaces. Other components can depend on this component 
  through its registered interface, but cannot depend on the implementation class 
  directly. <br>
  <br>
  The <span style="font-style: italic;">singleton</span> attribute indicates whether 
  the default implementation is a singleton. If true, then a single instance will 
  be created and shared between every other component that needs it. If false, 
  then a new instance will be created for each container that needs it. For example, 
  in the case of parts, singleton=:"false" would mean that one instance will be 
  created for every part.<br>
