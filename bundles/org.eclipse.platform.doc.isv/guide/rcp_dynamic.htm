<H2> Dynamic Plug-ins</H2>

<p>Dynamic Plug-ins provide the ability to insert and remove 
  plug-ins into a running instance of Eclipse. A reusable component with the potential 
  to be unloaded, Dynamic Plug-ins provide an easy way to help you track the comings 
  and goings of plug-ins. </p>
<p> A dynamic plug-in may not remain for the life of the 
  application, as such, it is essential to ensure that when the component goes 
  away everything is cleaned up. When listeners are 
  hooked on the Workbench and items are registered, they remain there after shut 
  down, these plug-ins must be aware that they need to clean up.</p>
<p>The assumption that on start up, a read through of all 
  the implementations of the extension point will be sufficient for the life of 
  the application is false as that will not work. You must ensure that either 
  the listener is hooked or that nothing is ever cashed, so that registry changes 
  are listened for. It is important to understand that items in the workbench 
  are not necessarily static, they are in fact transient and could go away at 
  any time. If you're writing a plug-in for a specific view first ensure that 
  the view is still there.</p>
<p>As a plug-in developer you need to ensure that any extensions 
  you may utilize are allowed to appear and disappear at any given point. When 
  they disappear you should acknowledge their disappearance by cleaning up any 
  internal structures that may represent the extensions and remove any UI artifacts 
  that they may drive. When they appear you should augment your internal structures 
  and possibly create new UI artifacts. Assume that 
  your application is reading from the registry and has an extension, you create 
  a record for it and assign its location. Upon its conclusion, you would be notified 
  that a clean up is required. In addition, a listener will announce when new 
  items come in and create them. </p>
<p>The org.eclipse.core.runtime.dynamicHelpers.IExtensionTracker and associated 
  interfaces provide a mechanism by which plug-in developers can easily track 
  the coming and going of extensions and manage the resources generated by such 
  actions.</p>
<p>The following example assumes that you have an extension point in your plug-in 
  called widgets and that you are using IExtensionTracker. Internally, you have 
  WidgetDescriptors that encapsulate widget extensions and a WidgetRegistry to 
  manage them. </p>
  <pre>


	public class WidgetRegistry implements IExtensionChangeHandler {

	
	
	  public WidgetRegistry() {
		
		IExtensionTracker tracker = PlatformUI.getWorkbench()
	
  	.getExtensionTracker();<br>
  	IExtensionPoint point = Platform.getExtensionRegistry()
    
		.getExtensionPoint(&quot;my.plugin.namespace&quot;, &quot;widget&quot;);<br>	
  	IExtension[] extensions = point.getExtensions();<br>
  	// initial population<br>
 	    for (int i = 0; i &lt; extensions.length; i++) {
		
			addExtension(tracker, extensions[i]);<br>
		}
		 

		tracker<br>
  	.registerHandler(this, tracker<br>
		.createExtensionPointFilter(point));
	}



	 public void addExtension(IExtensionTracker tracker, IExtension extension){
  
	 	WidgetDescriptor descriptor = new WidgetDescriptor(extension);
	 
		tracker.registerObject(extension, descriptor,<br>
  	IExtensionTracker.REF_STRONG);
		
		addToInternalStructure(descriptor)
	
	}



	private void addToInternalStructure(WidgetDescriptor descriptor) {

		// registry specific logic
  }



public void removeExtension(IExtension extension, Object[] objects) {

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; objects.length; i++) {

		WidgetDescriptor descriptor = (WidgetDescriptor) objects[i];<br>
	  	removeFromInternalStructure(descriptor);<br>
  }<br>
 }

	private void removeFromInternalStructure(WidgetDescriptor 
  descriptor) {
	
		// registry specific logic
  }<br>
}

 
  public void dispose() {

		PlatformUI.getWorkbench()
	
	    .getExtensionTracker().unregisterHandler(this)<br>
  }

}<br>
  
  </pre>


<p>In this example Platform UI provides IExtensionTracker instances at various 
  levels of the Workbench. If you're tracking objects that live for the life of 
  the workbench you should use the tracker provided by IWorkbench.getExtensionTracker(). 
  If your objects are relevant to particular workbench windows or pages, you should 
  use the trackers provided by IWorkbenchWindow.getExtensionTracker() or IWorkbenchPage.getExtensionTracker(). 
  For instance, Workbench tracks view descriptors at the Workbench level but tracks 
  actual view instances at the workbench page level. Your handlers may be registered 
  against particular extension points via providing an IFilter instance to IExtensionTracker.registerHandler(). 
  Your handler will only be called when extensions matching the IFilter object 
  are added or removed. </p>
<p>When an extension enters the runtime this method will be called. Your handler 
  then has the opportunity to incorporate the new extension into its associated 
  model. Any objects created based on the IExtension provided to this interface 
  should be registered against the tracker via IExtensionTracker.registerObject(). 
  When an extension leaves the runtime this method will be called. Any objects 
  previously registered against the extension will be passed as arguments. Your 
  handler may then clean up and dispose of the objects as necessary. It's good 
  practice to unregister your handlers so that your registries are not leaked.</p>
