Packaging and delivering Eclipse based products</H1>
<p><b>Note:</b> <i>This chapter is under development.&nbsp; The following is an
outline for the full content.</i></p>
<p>
  Intro - can use good wording from existing &quot;Eclipse-based Products and
  Extensions&quot; doc</p>
<h2>
  What is a product?</h2>
<p>Define product and show an example dir structure</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Definition.&nbsp; Groups of plug-ins, but doesn't contain the plug-ins.&nbsp;
Only refers to them.&nbsp; The notion of features is not relevant to the end
user, just to the update manager.&nbsp; (Refer to feature archive format
reference doc)</p>
<h3>Primary feature</h3>
<p>Controls branding stuff.&nbsp; (splash, about, welcome, default perspective -
how/where is this specified?)</p>
<p>Can be more than one, but only one at a time.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Plug-ins</h3>
<p>What we know and love.&nbsp; (Refer to plug-in archive format doc)</p>
<h2>Configuring and installing a product</h2>
<h3>Splash screen</h3>
<p>Show dir structure for simple case (not NL yet)</p>
<h3>About dialog</h3>
<p>Features and plug-ins supply about.html.</p>
<p>Features supply about.ini (and possibly about.properties and about.mappings).&nbsp;
Include format/examples and screen shots of such files.</p>
<h3>Installation guidelines</h3>
<p>No install tool is assumed.&nbsp; Can use your favorite native installer.</p>
<p>Overview of installation procedure includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sample directory structure</li>
  <li>marker files</li>
  <li>location of data vs. program (for uninstall and multi-user issues)</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to install ref doc for the details.</p>
<h2>National language considerations</h2>
<p>We should consider discussing NL here since it's mentioned in passing in
other places.</p>
<p>This would include a discussion of locales, fragments, dir structure, and
externalization.</p>
<h2>Product extensions</h2>
<p>Define extension and show example of dir structure.</p>
<p>Link files and where they go.</p>
<h2>Updating a product or extension</h2>
<p>Describe general process conceptually, but we don't get into the details of
site maps or update server structure.&nbsp; </p>
