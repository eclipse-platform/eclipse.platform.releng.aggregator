<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>A <b>command</b> is the declaration of a user action by <b>id</b>.&nbsp;
Commands are used to declare semantic actions so that action implementations defined
in action sets and editors can associate themselves with a particular semantic
command.&nbsp; The separation of the command from the action
implementation allows multiple plug-ins to define actions that implement the
same semantic command.&nbsp; The command is what gets associated with a
particular key binding.</p>


<p>The workbench defines many common commands in its <b>plugin.xml</b>
file, and plug-ins are encouraged to associate their own actions with these
commands where it makes sense.&nbsp; In this way, semantically similar
actions implemented in different plug-ins may share the same key binding.</p>


<h4>Defining a command</h4>


<p>Commands are defined using the <b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_commands.html">org.eclipse.ui.commands</a></b>
extension point.&nbsp; The following comes from the workbench markup:</p>


<pre>
&lt;extension
	point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.commands&quot;&gt;
	...
	&lt;command
		name="%command.save.name"
		description="%command.save.description"
		categoryId="org.eclipse.ui.category.file"
		id="org.eclipse.ui.file.save"&gt;
	&lt;/command&gt;
	...
</pre>


<p>The command definition specifies a <b>name</b>, <b>description</b>, and <b>id</b> for
the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also specifies the id of a category for the command, which is
used to group commands in the preferences dialog.&nbsp; The categories are also
defined in the <b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_commands.html">org.eclipse.ui.commands</a>
</b>
extension point:</p>
<pre>
      ...
      &lt;category
            name=&quot;%category.file.name&quot;
            description=&quot;%category.file.description&quot;
            id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.category.file&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/category&gt;
      ...
</pre><p>Note that there is no implementation specified for a
command.&nbsp; A command only becomes concrete when a plug-in
associates its action with the command id.</p>


<h4>Associating an action with a command</h4>


<p>Actions can be associated with a command in code or in the <b>plugin.xml
</b>for action sets.&nbsp;
Your choice depends on where the action is defined.</p>


<p>Actions that are instantiated in code can also be associated with an action
definition using <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/action/IAction.html"><b>IAction</b></a>
protocol.&nbsp; This is typically done when the action is created.&nbsp; The <b>SaveAction</b>
uses this technique when it initializes itself. </p>


<pre>
public SaveAction(IWorkbenchWindow window) {
	...
	setText...
	setToolTipText...
	setImageDescriptor...
	<b>setActionDefinitionId(&quot;org.eclipse.ui.file.save&quot;)</b>; 
}
</pre>

<p>(Note:&nbsp; The method name <b>setActionDefinitionID </b>could more
appropriately be named <b>setCommandID</b>.&nbsp; The method name reflects the
original implementation of key bindings and uses outdated terminology.)</p>


<p>By invoking <b>setActionDefinitionID</b>, the implementation action (<b>SaveAction</b>) is associated with
the command id that was used in the command definition markup. It is good practice to define constants for your action definitions so that
they are easily referenced in code. </p>

<p> If you define an
action in an action set, then you typically do not need to
instantiate an action yourself.&nbsp; The workbench will do it for you when the user
invokes your action from a menu or the keyboard.&nbsp; In this case, you can
associate your action with a command ID in your&nbsp; XML markup.&nbsp; The
following shows a hypothetical markup for an action set:</p>

<pre>
&lt;extension point = &quot;org.eclipse.ui.actionSets&quot;&gt;
	   &lt;actionSet id=&quot;com.example.actions.actionSet&quot;
		   label=&quot;Example Actions&quot;
		   visible=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
		   &lt;action id=&quot;com.example.actions.action1&quot;
			   menubarPath=&quot;additions&quot;
			   label=&quot;Example Save Action&quot;
			   class=&quot;org.example.actions.ExampleActionDelegate&quot;
			   <b>definitionID=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.file.save&quot;</b>&gt;
		   &lt;/action&gt;
		   ...
	   &lt;/actionSet&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
<p>The <b>definitionID</b> attribute is used to declare a command ID for the action.</p>


<p>Using either technique, associating your action with a command ID causes any key bindings that get defined for the
command <b>org.eclipse.ui.file.save
</b>to invoke your action when appropriate.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Now let's look at how these key bindings get defined. </p>
