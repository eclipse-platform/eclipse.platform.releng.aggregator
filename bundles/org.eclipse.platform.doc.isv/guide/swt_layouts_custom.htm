Custom layouts</H3>
<P >
Occasionally you may need to write your own custom <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Layout.html"><strong> Layout</strong></a> class. This is most appropriate when you have a complex layout that is used
in many different places in your application. It may be appropriate when you can optimize layout using application specific knowledge. Before building a custom layout you should consider the following:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Can the layout be achieved with an existing layout such as <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/GridLayout.html"><strong>
GridLayout</strong></a><strong> </strong>or by nesting several different layouts?</li>
  <li>Can the layout be isolated into a common resize listener?</li>
  <li>Are you defining a general layout algorithm with programmer supplied configuration parameters or just positioning widgets specifically for your application?</li>
</ul>
<P >
Unless you are writing a very generic layout that will be used by several <strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Composite.html"> Composite</a></strong> widgets, it is often simpler and easier to calculate sizes and position children in a resize listener. Many of the SWT custom widgets were written this way. Although a new widget can be implemented as a
<strong>Composite</strong>/<strong>Layout </strong> pair, implementing it as a
<strong><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Composite.html"> Composite</a></strong>
that does its layout in a resize listener and computes its preferred size in <strong> computeSize(...)</strong> is clearer, and does not require the writing of an extra class.</P>
<P >
If you still believe that you need a custom layout class then it is a good idea to first implement the layout algorithm in a resize listener. This makes for simpler debugging of the algorithm itself. Be sure to test the various cases for layout, which are resizing smaller, resizing larger, wrapping, and clipping.&nbsp;
Once you have the algorithm working, the code can be refactored into a subclass of
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Layout.html"><strong> Layout</strong></a>.&nbsp;</P>
<P >
 Layouts are responsible for implementing two methods:</P>
<ul>
  <li><strong>computeSize(...)</strong> calculates the width and height of a rectangle that encloses all of the composite's children once they have been sized and placed according to the layout algorithm. The hint parameters allow the width and/or height to be constrained. For example, a layout may choose to grow in one dimension if constrained in another.</li>
  <li><strong>layout(...)</strong> positions and sizes the composite's children. A layout can choose to cache layout-related information, such as the preferred extent of each of the children. The
    <strong> flushCache</strong> parameter tells the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Layout.html"><strong> Layout</strong></a>
    to flush cached data, which is necessary when other factors besides the size of the composite have changed, such as the creation of removal of children, or a change in the widget's font.</li>
</ul>
