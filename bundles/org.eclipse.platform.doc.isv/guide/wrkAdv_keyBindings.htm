<h2>Workbench key bindings</h2>
<p>The workbench defines many keyboard accelerators for invoking common actions
with the keyboard.&nbsp; When your plug-in defines a new action using the <b>actionSets</b>, <b>viewActions</b>, or <b>editorActions</b> extension points, an <b>accelerator</b> 
attribute can be specified with any action.&nbsp; This is one way to establish
the key combination that will invoke the action.&nbsp; However, allowing each
plug-in to define their own accelerator keys for actions introduces several
problems:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Different plug-ins may define the same accelerator for actions that are
    not related.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins may define different accelerators for actions that are
    semantically the same.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins may define accelerators that later conflict with the workbench
    (as the workbench is upgraded).</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to alleviate these problems, the platform defines a configurable key
binding strategy that is extendable by plug-ins.&nbsp; It solves the problems
listed above and introduces new capabilities:</p>


<ul>
  <li>The user can control which registered sets of key bindings should be used.</li>
  <li>Plug-ins can define key bindings that emulate other tools that may be
    familiar to users of the plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic strategy is that plug-ins use <b>action definitions</b> to define
semantic actions.&nbsp; Action definitions are simply declarations of an
action.&nbsp; They do not define an implementation for the action.&nbsp; When a
plug-in defines an action for an editor, action set, or view, the action can
specify that it is an implementation of one of these action definitions.&nbsp;
This allows semantically similar actions to be associated with the same action
definition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, plug-ins can define <b>accelerator sets</b> that map action
definitions to key combinations.&nbsp; These accelerator sets can be grouped
into <b>accelerator configurations</b> that the user may activate via the
Preferences dialog. </p>
<p>Finally, plug-ins can define <b>accelerator scopes</b> which determine the
lookup order for key bindings.</p>
<p>This is all best understood by walking through the workbench and looking at
how actions and accelerators are declared.&nbsp; We'll look at all of this from
the point of view of defining key bindings for existing actions.&nbsp; Then
we'll review it all again from the user's point of view.</p>
