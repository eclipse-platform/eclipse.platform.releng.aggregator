<H1>Common Navigator Framework</H1>


<p>The Common Navigator Framework (CNF) provides a general purpose
configurable navigator view which can be shared by many applications
working with the same set of resources or other objects, presenting a
integrated view to the end user. It is implemented by the <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.ui.navigator</a></b> plugin.</p>
<p>The main part of the CNF is the <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/CommonNavigator.html">CommonNavigator
</a></b> which is a <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IViewPart.html">IViewPart </a></b> 
implementation. The Common Navigator instance in the IDE workbench is
called the <b>Project Explorer</b>. Note that the <b>Package
Explorer</b> in the IDE is part of the <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/views/navigator/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator
</a></b> package and is unrelated to the Common Navigator.</p>

<p>With the CNF you can define one or more view parts and associate
each view part with content extensions, filters, wizards, and sets of
actions. Each view instance is defined by an extension. Each content
extension, filter, wizard and action provider is defined by another
extension which allows these to be shared among the view part(s).</p>

<h2>Components of the Common Navigator Framework</h2>

<p>The CNF has the following major parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>View Part</b> - <b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/CommonNavigator.html">CommonNavigator
	</a></b>.</li>
	<li><b>Viewer</b> -<b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/CommonViewer.html">CommonViewer
	</a></b> the implementation of a viewer that is contained in the above view
	part.</li>
	<li><b>Content Service</b> - <b><a
		href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/INavigatorContentService.html">INavigatorContentService
	</a></b> a service that manages content extensions and allows them to be
	discovered based on objects associated with a viewer. Most users do not
	interact directly with the Content Service, but it is possible to use
	it independently from the common navigator view part.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Content Extensions</h2>

<p>The CNF allows you to include not only resources but any type of
object. One typical use case is that of a resource (consider a Java file
for example) which has several subordinate objects presented as tree
nodes representing aspects of the class like imports, methods, etc. The
CommonViewer (portion of the Common Navigator) will include the
IResource object representing the Java file, and then as its children an
object for each import, method, etc. The mechanism for defining this is
a <b><a href="cnf_config.htm#contentExtension">content extension</a></b>.</p>

<p>Each content extension also provides a means of associating
objects with appropriate icons, labels and menu items.</p>

<p>Content extensions are invoked based on an enablement expression
which is defined using core expressions in the extension point.
Enablement expressions are commonly defined by sensing the class of an
object.</p>

<p>A priority may be associated with a content extension which
indicates the category of importance of the extension related to other
extensions. It's possible that more than one content extension may be
enabled for a given object and situation. In this case the priority
mechanism is used to select the one extension to use. Priorities are
defined with words like "high" or "normal". A high priority would be
associated with an extension that defines the primary UI for frequently
manipulating an object. A low priority would be given to relatively
infrequent utility sorts of UI.</p>

<p>Content extensions may be activated and deactivated for a given
view part in the UI using the <b>Customize View</b> menu item in the
header menu associated with the view part. Common filters are also may
also be activated and deactivated the same way.</p>

<h2>Common Filters</h2>

<p>Filters allow the user to specify which resources or objects to
exclude. Like content extensions, filters may be specified centrally and
shared.</p>

<h2>Common Wizards</h2>

<p>References to wizards for new/import/export may be defined. These
are included in the appropriate popup menu based on the enablement.</p>

<h2>Action Providers</h2>

<p>Action providers provide a means to configure the retargetable
actions and programmatically configure the popup menu in a CNF viewer.
These are useful for when you must perform a computation to determine
which items are added to the menu, or to adjust the retargetable actions
to ensure that the user keystrokes are handled properly (like for
Cut/Copy/Paste).</p>

<h2>Drag and Drop Support</h2>

<p>A drop assistant may be associated with a content extension to
provide handling of additional (non-standard) transfer types or
validation in the event of a drop.</p>


<h2>Built in Resource Support</h2>

<p><b><a href="../guide/resInt.htm">Resources </a></b> are one of
the main types of objects managed by the CNF. To support this the <b><a
	href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/resources/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources</a></b> plug-in provides all of the
necessary definitions. The Project Explorer in the IDE is configured
using these definitions.</p>

<h2>Configuring the Common Navigator</h2>

<p><b><a href="../guide/cnf_config.htm">Configuring the
Common Navigator </a></b> gives the overview of how the CNF is configured. For
further details, see the extension point documentation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_viewer.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.viewer</a></b></li>
	<li><b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_navigatorContent.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent</a></b></li>
	<li><b><a
		href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_navigator_linkHelper.html">org.eclipse.ui.navigator.linkHelper</a></b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Rich Client Platform Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>The Common Navigator can be used in RCP applications to allow
full access and manipulation of the resource workspace. This can be
accomplished very quickly by using the <b><a
	href="../guide/cnf_rcp.htm">Using the Common Navigator in RCP </a></b>
 instructions.</p>
