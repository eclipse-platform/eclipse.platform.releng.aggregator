<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.3 and 4.4</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.3 and 4.4 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 4.3 plug-ins to 4.4. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.3 plug-in on 4.4.

<h2>1. <a name="workspaceLock">Removed WorkspaceLock API</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that directly reference WorkspaceLock API.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The <code>WorkspaceLock</code> API allowed a special client (usually platform UI) to
hook into the locking protocols used by the workspace implementation. This hook
was used to mitigate deadlocks due to interaction with synchronous SWT events,
and was never intended to be used by other clients. In the 3.0 release this API
was deprecated in favor of a more general API provided by the <code>org.eclipse.core.jobs</code>
bundle. Invoking this API has had no effect since the 3.0 release. The specific API
being removed includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.WorkspaceLock</code> class.</li>
<li>The method <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace#setWorkspaceLock</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that directly use API listed above should remove any references to it.
