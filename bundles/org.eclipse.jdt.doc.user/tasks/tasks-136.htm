    <h1>
      Stepping through the execution of a Java program
    </h1>
    <p>
      When a thread is suspended, the step controls can be used to step through the execution of the program line-by-line.
      If a breakpoint is encountered while performing a step operation,&nbsp;
      the execution will suspend at the breakpoint and the step operation is
      ended.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Step over
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in that stack frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Step Over</strong> button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <kbd>F6</kbd> key. The currently-selected line is executed and
        suspends on the next executable line.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Step into
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Step Into</strong> button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <kbd>F5</kbd> key. The next expression on the currently-selected
        line to be executed is invoked, and execution suspends at the next executable line in the method that is invoked.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
<h2> Step into Selection</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in 
    the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective. 
  </li>
  <li>In the Java editor, within the current line of execution, place the cursor 
    on the name of a method that you would like to step into.</li>
  <li> Click the <strong>Step into Selection </strong>action in the Run menu or 
    Java editor context menu, or press the <kbd>Ctrl-F5</kbd> key. Execution resumes 
    until the selected method is invoked. </li>
</ol>
    <h2>
      Step with filters
    </h2>
    
<ol>
  <li>Toggle the <strong>Use Step Filters</strong> button in the Debug view toolbar, 
    or use <kbd>Shift+F5</kbd>. When the action is toggled on, each of the step 
    actions (over, into, return) will apply the set of step filters which are 
    defined in the user preferences (see <strong>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; 
    Java &gt; Debug &gt; Step Filtering</strong>). When a step action is invoked, 
    stepping will continue until an unfiltered location is reached or a breakpoint 
    is encountered.</li>
</ol>
    <h2>
      Run to return
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Run to Return</strong> button in the Debug view toolbar or press the <kbd>F7</kbd> key. Execution resumes until the next return
        statement in the current method is executed, and execution suspends on the next executable line.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Run to line
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a thread is suspended, it is possible to resume execution until a specified line is executed. This is a convenient way to suspend execution at a line without setting a
      breakpoint.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place your cursor on the line at which you want the program to run.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select <strong>Run to Line</strong> from the pop-up menu or use
        <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>. Program execution is resumed and suspends just before the specified line is to be executed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is possible that the line will never be hit and that the program will not suspend.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Breakpoints and exceptions can cause the thread to suspend before reaching the specified
        line.</p>
