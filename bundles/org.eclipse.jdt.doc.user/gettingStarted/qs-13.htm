<h1> Debugging your programs </h1>
<p> In this section, you will debug a Java program. </p>
<ol>
  <li> In the Package Explorer view in the Java perspective, double-click <em>junit.samples/VectorTest.java</em> 
    to open it in an editor. </li>
  <li> Place your cursor on the vertical ruler along the left edge of the editor
    area on the following line in the setUp() method: 
    <p> <code>fFull.addElement (new Integer(1));</code> </p>
    <p> and double-click on the ruler to set a breakpoint. </p>
    <p> <img src="images/editor_vectortest_debug.png"  alt="VectorTest.java editor showing added breakpoint"> 
    </p>
    The breakpoint icon indicates the status of the breakpoint.&nbsp; The plain
    blue breakpoint icon indicates that the breakpoint has been set, but not yet
    installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p>
    <em>Note: Once the class is loaded by the Java VM, the breakpoint will be
    installed and a checkmark overlay will be displayed on the breakpoint icon.</em> </p></li>
  <li> In the Package Explorer view, select the <em>junit.samples</em> package 
    and select <strong>Debug As</strong>, and then <strong>Java 
    Application</strong>.&nbsp; When you run a program from a package, you will be
    prompted to choose a type from all classes in the package that define a <code>main
    </code>method.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Select the <em>VectorTest</em> item in the dialog, 
    then click <strong>OK</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="images/select_java_app_dialog.png"  alt="Type selection dialog"> </p>
    <p><em>Note: You can also simply hit the debug button <img src="images/debug_button.png" alt="Debug button"> 
      which will launch the currently selected resource or active editor. Select 
      <strong>Java Application </strong>when you are prompted to select a way 
      to debug VectorTest.</em></p>
	  <p><img src="images/select_how.png" alt="Select way to debug VectorTest"></p>
  </li>
  <li> The program will run until the breakpoint is reached.&nbsp; When the breakpoint is hit, execution 
    is suspended, and you are asked whether to open the Debug perspective.  Click <strong>Yes</strong>.
    Notice that the process is still active (not terminated) in 
    the Debug view. Other threads might still be running.
    <p> <img src="images/workbench_debug_vectortest.png"  alt="Debug perspective"> </p>
    <em>Note: The breakpoint now has a checkmark overlay <img src="images/active_break_point.png" alt="Breakpoint with overlay"> since the class
    VectorTest was loaded in the Java VM.</em> </li>
  <li> In the editor in the Debug perspective, select <code>new Vector()</code> from the line above
    where the breakpoint is set, and from its context menu, select <strong>Inspect</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="images/editor_vectortest_inspect.png"  alt="VectorTest.java editor with selected breakpoint line showing context menu"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> The expression is evaluated in the context of the current stack frame, 
    and a pop-up appears which displays the results. You can send a result to
    the Expressions view by pressing the key binding displayed in the pop-up.
  </li>
  <li> Expressions that you evaluate while debugging a program will be listed in
    this view. To delete an expression after working with it, select the
    expression and choose <strong>Remove</strong> from its context menu. 
  </li>
  <li> The Variables view (available on a tab along with the Expressions view) displays the values of the variables in the selected 
    stack frame. Expand the this.fFull tree in the Variables view until you can see 
    elementCount. 
  </li>
  <li> The variables (e.g., elementCount) in the Variables view will change when
    you step 
    through VectorTest in the Debug view.&nbsp; To step through the code, click the 
    <strong>Step Over</strong> (<img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepover_co.png" alt="Step Over" >) button.&nbsp;
    Execution will continue at the next line in the same method 
      (or, if you are at the end of a method, it will continue in the method from 
      which the current method was called).
    <p> <img src="images/view_variables_1.png"  alt="Variables view"> </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the variables view you can choose to see certain types as logical structures. This hides the implementation details of a 
  type and simply shows it as arrays or fields. You can define logical structures by yourself in the preference page <strong>Java &gt; Debug &gt; Logical Structures</strong>.
  <p> <img src="images/view_variables_logical_structures.png" alt="fFull shown as logical structure"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Try some other step buttons 
    (<strong>Step Into <img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepinto_co.png" alt="Step Into" >, 
    Step Return <img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepreturn_co.png" alt="Step Return" >) </strong>to
    step through the code.&nbsp; Note the differences in stepping techniques.
  </li>
  <li> You can end a debugging session by allowing the program to run to
    completion or by terminating it.
    <ul>
      <li>You can continue to step over the code with the <strong>Step </strong>buttons
        until the program completes.</li>
      <li>You can click the&nbsp; <strong>Resume </strong>  
      (<img src="../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/resume_co.png" alt="Resume" >) button to allow the
        program to run until the next breakpoint is encountered or until the
        program is completed.</li>
      <li>You can select 
    <strong>Terminate</strong> from the context menu of the program's
        process in the Debug view to terminate the program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
