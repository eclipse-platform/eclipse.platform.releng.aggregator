    <h1>Java Build Path page</h1>

    <p>The options in this page indicate the build path settings for a Java project.<br>
     You can reach this page through</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="ref-121.htm">New Java Project wizard</a></li>

      <li>the Java Build Path property page (Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java Build Path) from the context menu on a created project or the <a href="ref-menu-file.htm">File
      menu</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The build class path is a list of paths visible to the compiler when building the project.</p>

    <h2>Source tab</h2>

    <p>Source folders are the root of packages containing .java files. The compiler will translate the contained files to .class files that will be written to the output folder. 
The output folder is defined per project except if a source folder specifies an own output folder. Each source folder can define an exclusion filter to specify which 
resources inside the folder should not be visible to the compiler.<br>
Resources existing in source folders are also copied to the output folder unless the setting in the <a href="ref-preferences-compiler.htm">Compiler preference
    page</a> (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Build Path) specifies that the resource is filtered.</p>

    <p>The tree shows the project as it will look like when switching to the package explorer. Several operations can be executed 
	on this tree to change the structure of the project.</p>

			<td align="left" valign="top">Allows to add a folder or package to the Java build path and change it to a source folder. A source folder is a toplevel 
				folder in the project hierarchy that is used as the root of packages. Entries on the build path like source folders are visible to the compiler 
				and all contained resources like .java files are used to build the project. Source folders allow to structure the project, for example to separate 
				test from the application in two source folders. Within a source folder, a more detailed structuring can be done by using packages.

			<td align="left" valign="top">Allows to add a resource to the exclusion filter of it's parent source folder. The consequence is that

			<td align="left" valign="top">Editing can be used in two situations: <p>
				<ol>
				<li>Customize the inclusion and exclusion filters by defining string patterns. This can be usefull if 
				including or excluding every single resource would take too long and just some simple patterns can do the job. A very 
				practical operator is the wildcard operator to define more sophisticated patterns (for example exclude all resources 
				that start with "Test*.java").</li>
				<li>Change the output folder for a source folder. The consequence is that all generated 
				.class files from the .java files in this source folder are will be generated in the separate output folder instead of the 
				project's output folder.</li>
				</ol>
				Note that this advanced action is only available on single selected objects.

<p>Note that a shorter description of all operations is visible in the area at the buttom of the project tree (labeled with 'Description'). Only the descriptions 
which are valid for the current selection on the project are shown. For experienced users it is also possible to close the description area to view 
the projects structure enlarged.</p>


<dl>
      <dt>The source folders offered as default by the New Java Project wizard are configured in the <a href="ref-preferences-new-project.htm">New Project preference
      page</a> (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; New Project).</dt>
    </dl>

    <h2>Projects tab</h2>

    <p>In the <b>Required projects on the build path</b> list, you can add project dependencies by selecting other workbench
    projects to add to the build path for this new project. The <b>Select All</b> and <b>Deselect All</b> buttons can be used to add or remove all other projects to or from the build path.</p>

    <p>Adding a required project indirectly adds all its classpath entries marked as 'exported'. Setting a classpath entry as exported is done in the Order and Export tab.</p>

    <p>The projects selected here are automatically added to the referenced projects list. The referenced project list is used to determine the build order. A project is always
    build after all its referenced projects are built.</p>

    <h2>Libraries tab</h2>

    <p>On this page, you can add libraries to the build path. You can add:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Workbench-managed (internal) JAR files</li>

      <li>File system (external) JAR files</li>

      <li>Folders containing CLASS files</li>
	<li>Predefined libraries like the JRE System Library</li>
</ul>

    <p>JAR files can also be added indirectly as class path variables.</p>

    <p>By default, the library list contains an entry representing the Java runtime library.  This entry points to the JRE
    selected as the default JRE. The default JRE is configured in the <a href="ref-18.htm">Installed JREs preferences page</a> (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Installed
    JREs)</p>

          <td align="left" valign="top">Add Variable</td>

          <td align="left" valign="top">Allows you to add classpath variables to the build path. Classpath variables are an indirection to JARs with the benefit of avoiding local
          file system paths in a classpath. This is needed when projects are shared in a team.<br>
           Variables can be created and edited in the <a href="ref-15.htm">Classpath Variable preference page</a> (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Classpath Variables)</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Add Class Folder</td>

          <td>Allows to navigate the workbench hierarchy and select a class folder for the build path. The selection dialog also allows you to create a new folder.</td>

<h2>Order and Export tab</h2>

    <p>In the <b>Build class path order</b> list, you can click the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons to move the selected path entry up or down in the build path order for this new project.</p>

    <p>Checked list entries are marked as exported. Exported entries are visible to projects that require the project. Use the <b>Select
    All</b> and <b>Deselect All</b> to change the checked state of all entries. Source folders are always exported,
    and can not be deselected.</p>

    <h2>Default output folder</h2>

    <p>At the bottom of this page, the <b>Default output folder</b> field allows you to enter a path to a folder path where the compilation output for this
    project will reside. The default output is used for source folders that do not specify an own output folder. Use <b>Browse</b> to select an existing location from the current project. The default for this field is configured in the <a href=
    "ref-preferences-new-project.htm">New Project preference page</a> (Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; New Project).</p>
