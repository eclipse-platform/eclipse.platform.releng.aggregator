    <h1>
      Java Projects
    </h1>
    <p>
      A Java project contains source code and related files for building a Java program. It has an
      associated Java builder that can incrementally compile Java source files as they are changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Java project also maintains a model of its contents. This model includes information about
      the type hierarchy, references and declarations of Java elements. This information is
      constantly updated as the user changes the Java source code. The updating of the internal
      Java project model is independent of the Java builder; in particular, when performing code
      modifications, if auto-build is turned off, the model will still reflect the present project
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>

      You can organize Java projects in two different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Using the project as the source container. This is the recommended organization for
        simple projects.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Using source folders inside the project as the source container. This is the
        recommended organization for more complex projects. It allows you to subdivide packages
        into groups.</span>

      </li>
    </ul>
