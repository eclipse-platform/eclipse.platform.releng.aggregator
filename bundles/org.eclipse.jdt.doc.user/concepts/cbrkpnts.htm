    <h1>Breakpoints</h1>

    <p>A breakpoint causes the execution of a program thread to suspend at the location where the breakpoint is set.</p>

    <p>Breakpoints can be enabled and disabled via their context menus in the Breakpoints view.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When a breakpoint is enabled, it will cause a thread to suspend whenever
        the breakpoint is reached. Enabled breakpoints are indicated with a blue circle. Enabled breakpoints
        are shown with a checkmark overlay after their class is loaded by the VM
        and the breakpoint is successfully installed.</li>

      <li>When a breakpoint is disabled, it will not cause threads to suspend. Disabled breakpoints are indicated with a white circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Breakpoints are displayed in the vertical editor ruler and in the Breakpoints view.</p>
