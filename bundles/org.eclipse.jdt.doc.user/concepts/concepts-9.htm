    <h1>Refactoring support</h1>

    <p>The goal of Java program refactoring is to make system-wide code changes without affecting the behavior of the
    program. The Java tools provide assistance in easily refactoring code.
    </p>

    <p>The refactoring tools support a number of transformations described in Martin Fowler's
    book <span class="name">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</span>, Addison Wesley
    1999, such as <span class="name">Extract Method</span>, <span class="name">Inline Local
    Variable, etc.</span></p>

    <p>When performing a refactoring operation, you can optionally preview all
    of the changes resulting from a refactoring action before you choose to carry them out.
    When previewing a refactoring operation, you will be notified of potential
    problems and will be presented with a list of the changes the
    refactoring action will perform. If you do not preview a refactoring
    operation, the change will be made in its entirety and any resultant
    problems will be shown. If a problem is detected that does not allow
    the refactoring to continue, the operation will be halted and a list of
    problems will be displayed.</p>

    <p>Refactoring commands are available from the context menus of several Java views (e.g. Package Explorer, Outline) and editors.
    Many &quot;apparently simple&quot; commands, such as <strong>Move</strong> and <strong>Rename</strong>, are
    actually refactoring operations, since moving and renaming Java elements
    often require changes in dependent files.
