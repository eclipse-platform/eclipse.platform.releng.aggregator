<h3>Bug Found</h3>
The new added empty folder is not found by the compare. 
Note that the change will be found if the new added folder is not empty.
Also noticed that I tried to commit the change after a new empty folder was
added, but the commit failed to check in this folder. Because of this above,
deleteion of a released empty folder can not be tested so far.
