#   Utility to test the runTests2.xml file. It's intended to allow rapid confirmation
#   that the runTests2.xml file computes correct values, for various versions platforms
#   and various versions of java and ant, etc.

#   In particular, ant can be invoked with one version of java, but another version
#   of java used to actually run the tests.

#   In addition to the console output. which should be captured, with something like
#      ./testTextXMLScript.sh | tee testoutput.txt
#   some data or set-up files will be created as they normally would if running the real tests.
#   The can be checked to be sure they are correct, and in correct (relative) locations.
