      name="mozTocId315234" />Target Operating Environments
  </h2>
  <p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse Project release targets reasonably current operating environments.</p>
  <p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is "pure" Java code and has no direct dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore on the Java Platform itself. Portions are
    targeted to specific classes of operating environments, requiring their source code to only reference facilities available in particular class libraries (e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.1, J2SE 1.4, Java
    5, etc).</p>
  <p>In general, the 4.29 release of the Eclipse Project is developed on Java SE 17 VMs. As such, the Eclipse SDK as a whole is targeted at all modern, desktop Java VMs.</p>
  <p>
    <a href="#appendix">Appendix 1</a> contains a table that indicates the class library level required for each bundle.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many different implementations of the Java Platform running atop a variety of operating systems. We focus our testing on a handful of popular combinations of operating system and Java
    Platform; these are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we do not systematically
    test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower priority than
    problems with running Eclipse on a reference platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eclipse 4.29 is tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. For the complete list, see <a
      href="https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_29.xml#target_environments">Target Environments in the
      4.29 Plan</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As stated above, <i>we expect that Eclipse works fine on other current Java VM and OS versions but we cannot flag these as reference platforms without significant community support for testing
      them.</i>
  </p>
  <p>The Eclipse SDK is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages, are
    externalized. The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles.</p>
  <p>Latin-1, DBCS, and BiDi locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all reference platforms.</p>
  <p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page standard, on Windows, Linux and the Macintosh.</p>
  <p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>

    </a><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_29_porting_guide.html"><em>Eclipse 4.29 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points
    will need to be ported to Eclipse SDK 4.29 APIs. Downward contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 4.29 APIs would ensure compliance with
    Eclipse SDK 4.28 APIs. Refer to <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs"><em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em></a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain contract
    compatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.29 is upwards binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 4.28 except in those areas noted in the <a
      href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_29_porting_guide.html"><em>Eclipse 4.29 Plug-in Migration Guide</em> </a>. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported.
    Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 4.29 will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 4.28. Refer to <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs"> <em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em></a> for a discussion of
    the kinds of API changes that maintain binary compatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.29 is upwards source-compatible with Eclipse SDK 4.28 except in the areas noted in the <a
      href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_29_porting_guide.html"><em>Eclipse 4.29 Plug-in Migration Guide</em> </a>. This means that source files written to use Eclipse
    SDK 4.29 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse SDK 4.28 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new Eclipse SDK
    APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.29 is upwards workspace-compatible with earlier 3.x and 4.x versions of the Eclipse SDK unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects
    created with Eclipse SDK 4.28, 4.27, 4.26, 4.25, 4.24, 4.23, 4.22, 4.21, 4.20, 4.19, 4.18, 4.17, 4.16, 4.15, 4.14, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 and 4.4 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 4.29 and upgraded to a 4.29 workspace. This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a
    particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual
    plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 4.29 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 4.29 plug-in developers are
    responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize metadata from earlier versions and process it appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded.
    Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or opened) by a product based on Eclipse 4.29 will be unusable with a product based on an earlier version of Eclipse. Visible
    metadata files created (or overwritten) by Eclipse 4.29 will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Non-compliant usage of API's</strong>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name or x-internal in the bundle manifest entry, are
    considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything other than what is
    specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less with earlier releases. Refer to <a
      href="https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API-Use/index.html"> <em>How to Use the Eclipse API</em></a> for information about how to write compliant plug-ins.

  <p>
    <a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId693657">Here are some common problems that can cause Eclipse not to start:</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId693657">As shown </a><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">above</a>, Eclipse 4.29 requires at least a Java SE 17. Perhaps an older version of the VM is being found in your path. To
      explicitly specify which VM to run with, use the Eclipse <code>-vm</code> command-line argument. (See also the <a href="#RunningEclipse">Running Eclipse</a> section below.)</li>
    <li>Eclipse must be installed to a clean directory and not installed over top of a previous installation. If you have done this then please re-install to a new directory. If your workspace is
      in a child directory of your old installation directory, then see the instructions below on "<a href="#Upgrading">Upgrading Workspace from a Previous Release"</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Java sometimes has difficulty detecting whether a file system is writable. In particular, the method java.io.File.canWrite() appears to return true in unexpected cases (e.g., using
      Windows drive sharing where the share is a read-only Samba drive). The Eclipse runtime generally needs a writable configuration area and as a result of this problem, may erroneously detect the
      current configuration location as writable. The net result is that Eclipse will fail to start and depending on the circumstances, may fail to write a log file with any details. To work around
      this, we suggest users experiencing this problem set their configuration area explicitly using the <code>-configuration</code> command line argument. (bug <a

      the Eclipse install if you want to open more then one workspace at the same time (bug </a><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=139319">139319</a>).

  <p>If you need to launch Eclipse from the command line, you can create a symbolic link such as "eclipse". It should point to the eclipse executable inside the application bundle and takes the
    same arguments as "eclipse.exe" on other platforms.</p>

    <a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId226004">Sharing projects between heterogeneous Eclipse 4.29 and 4.28</a>
  </h4>
  <p>Special care is required when a project in a team repository is being loaded and operated on by developers using Eclipse-based products based on different feature or plug-in versions. The
    general problem is that the existence, contents, and interpretation of metadata files in the workspaces may be specific to a particular feature or plug-in version, and differ between versions. The
    workspace compatibility guarantees only cover cases where all developers upgrade their Eclipse workspaces in lock step. In those cases there should be no problem with shared metadata. However,
    when some developers are working in Eclipse 4.29 while others are working in Eclipse 3.x, there are no such guarantees. This section provides advice for what to do and not to do. It addresses the
    specific issues with the Eclipse SDK.</p>
  <p>The typical failure mode is noticed by the 4.29 user. 4.28 metadata is lost when a 4.29 user saves changes and then commits the updated metadata files to the repository. Here's how things
    typically go awry:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A user working in Eclipse 4.29 creates or modifies a project in a way that results in changes to a shared metadata file that rely on 4.29-specific information. The user then commits the
      updated project files, including the shared metadata file, to the shared repository.</li>
    <li><a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId226004">Another user working in Eclipse 4.28 or earlier shares this project from the same repository. The 4.29-specific information in the shared metadata file is not understood
        by Eclipse 4.28, and is generally discarded or ignored without warning. The user modifies the project in a way that results in changes to the shared metadata file, causing the shared metadata
        file to be rewritten without any of the 4.29-specific information. The user commits the updated project files, including the shared metadata file, to the shared repository. The user is
        generally unaware that shared information has just been lost as a result of their actions.</a></li>
    <li><a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId226004">A user working in Eclipse 4.29 picks up the changes to a project from the shared repository, including the updated shared metadata file. The user may be unaware that
        they have just taken a retrograde step until later when things start to malfunction.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a

        4.29, and the project is subsequently loaded into an Eclipse 3.5 or earlier workspace, these folders will not be recognized. Recommendation: avoid creating virtual folders where project
        compatibility with Eclipse 3.5 or earlier is required.</a></li>
    <li><a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId226004"><b>Resource filters</b> - Eclipse 4.29 supports a notion of <i>resource filters</i> that did not exist in Eclipse 3.5 or earlier. If such filters are added to resources
        in 4.29, and the project is subsequently loaded into an Eclipse 3.5 or earlier workspace, these filters will not be recognized. Recommendation: avoid creating resource filters where project
        compatibility with Eclipse 3.5 or earlier is required.</a></li>
    <li><a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId226004"><b>Predefined path variables</b> - Eclipse 4.29 supports a set of built in path variables that can be used as the basis for linked resource locations. Such variables
        will not be defined automatically in Eclipse 3.5 or earlier. If compatibility with 3.5 or earlier workspace is required, users on 3.5 or earlier workspaces will need to define such path
        variables manually.</a></li>
